## [2.5.2] — 2026-05-10

### Added

- **prompt-gate skill** (`skills/prompt-gate/SKILL.md`) — auto-loaded via every
  preset's `global-instructions.md`. Detects vague prompts and enriches them by
  reading workspace context, scanning local files, asking up to 3 grounded
  clarifying questions, then executing with full context. Bypass with `*` prefix.
- **correcting-course rule** (`prompts/correcting-course.md`) — auto-loaded via
  every preset's `global-instructions.md`. When the user says output is off,
  emits a structured form with preset adjustment chips (tone, scope, format,
  depth, sources) plus an "Other" free-text escape — no need to retype context.
- New `prompts/` directory at repo root for cross-cutting workflow rules
  injected into preset `global-instructions.md` files.
- `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` updated: new `## Direct Pattern Incorporations`
  section with the `addyosmani/agent-skills` MIT entry covering the 4-phase
  context-enrichment pattern incorporated into `skills/prompt-gate/SKILL.md`.

### Changed

- All 7 presets' `global-instructions.md` files gained two appended sections
  (`## Prompt enrichment (prompt-gate)` and `## Correcting course`). Existing
  content is byte-unchanged.
- `curated-skills-registry.md` adds a `prompt-gate` row under Project
  Management with cross-cutting `goal_tags`.

### Patch-Level Exception (process note)

A new opt-in skill (prompt-gate) ships at patch level here because the v2.6
minor slot is publicly committed to multi-tool skill authoring. The skill is
auto-loaded via global-instructions but can be removed from any preset's
`global-instructions.md` without other changes. Future new-skill cycles
default back to minor version bumps.

### Compliance

- MIT attribution preserved for the upstream pattern source
  (`addyosmani/agent-skills` @ `9534f44c5448086fcc0046f9d83752c654c81930`):
  full permission notice embedded in `skills/prompt-gate/SKILL.md` footer
  (Option A, self-contained) and full license text in
  `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` (`## Direct Pattern Incorporations`).
- Phase 2 `/legal` review: PASS WITH MUST-FIX (2 WARNING / 4 INFO);
  CF-L1-1 and CF-L1-2 resolved by the additions above.

---

## [2.5.1] — 2026-05-09

Doc-only patch: Extended Thinking + Opus onboarding guidance added to three user-facing files.

- README.md Quick-start: two leading bullets added ("Toggle Extended Thinking ON" and "Select Opus 4.x in the model dropdown")
- SETUP-CHECKLIST.md: new "Before you start" preface section at the top of the file with the same two items
- WIZARD.md: "Before we begin — model check" section updated to reference Opus 4.x + Extended Thinking explicitly (replaces "Sonnet or higher"); `opusplan` notes for Research/Writing/PM presets unchanged

---

## [2.5.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- ADR-028: `content_sha256` per-file integrity field backfilled across all 110 entries in `cowork.lock.json`. The sync workflow now verifies `content_sha256` on every pull before accumulating changes — mismatches abort with a CI error.
- `tests/fixtures/sha-fault-injection.json` — CI fixture for lock-content-sha fault-injection test (asserts mismatch fires).
- `lock-content-sha-fault-injection` CI job — regression test that the verify logic fires on the DEADBEEF fixture.
- `lock-content-sha-cross-check` CI job — cross-environment trust anchor: recomputes SHA on PR and compares to lock (C-v2.5-19).
- ADR-029: `tools:` SKILL.md frontmatter field — closed vocabulary `[claude-code, copilot, cursor, windsurf]`. Default-when-absent rule (assume `claude-code` at runtime). CI vocab gate (MF-3) enforces all pool skills declare an inline-array `tools:` value.
- `tools: [claude-code]` added to all 20 skills in `skills/*/SKILL.md`. All 21 `examples/*/SKILL.md` byte-mirrored (ADR-018 research-synthesis exemption applied). MF-3 CI gate blocks vocab violations and multi-line YAML form (MF-S1 MUST-FIX).
- ADR-030: Outbound contribution model — `upstream-contribution/` working directory convention, attribution-via-PR-description policy. First outbound submission: meeting-notes skill to `msitarzewski/agency-agents`.
- `upstream-contribution/meeting-notes-upstream.md` — upstream-format version of meeting-notes skill. Writing-profile reference stripped (CF-L1-1). Attribution line in PR description (CF-L4-1).
- Upstream contribution: [PR #521](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents/pull/521) — meeting-notes skill submitted to `project-management/` category.
- MF-3 vocabulary gate in `quality.yml` — closed allowlist, multi-line YAML form rejected (MF-S1 MUST-FIX).
- MF-1 hardening: `set -o pipefail` per-step scope + `|| BAD=0` pattern replaces `|| true` (CF-v2.4-G / AC-F4-1).
- MF-2 hardening: structural header scan replacing positional `$7` (MF-S2 MUST-FIX / AC-F4-3). awk finds `goal_tags` column by name; skips backtick-wrapped documentation rows.
- `tests/fixtures/registry-column-reorder.md` — regression fixture for MF-2 structural scan (goal_tags at column 3 with BAD_TOKEN).
- `scripts/install-pre-commit.sh` — local markdownlint pre-commit hook installer. Closes the v2.3.0 MD058 gap. Same ruleset as CI `markdown-lint` step.
- `docs/security-review-v2.5.md`, `docs/compliance-review-v2.5.md` — Phase 2 review documents for this cycle.

### Changed
- MF-2 awk now uses structural header scan (goal_tags found by column name, not positional index) — making it resilient to column-reorder in `curated-skills-registry.md`.
- `quality.yml` `skill-depth-check` job: `upstream-contribution/` excluded from depth-check (follows upstream format, not Cowork 9-section template). ADR-016 v2.5 amendment.
- `docs/architecture.md`: ADR-028 ACCEPTED, ADR-029, ADR-030, ADR-007 amendment (v2.5), ADR-016 amendment (v2.5) added.

---

## [2.4.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- `skills/` root pool — 20 SKILL.md files (7 presets × 3 skills, minus 1 ADR-018 dedup for research-synthesis). Canonical copy drives all install operations.
- `selection-presets.md` — 7 preset blocks in fenced ` ```preset ` format with `name`, `display_name`, `description`, `skill_bundle`, `scaffold_source`, `match_signals` keys. Authoritative keyword sets for F3 matcher.
- Dynamic goal matcher (F3) in WIZARD.md — keyword set-intersection over `match_signals`, deterministic, no LLM sub-call. Three paths: A (single preset), B (tie), C (novel/custom). STOPWORDS cross-referenced (SF-1).
- Q&A bundle customization (F4) in WIZARD.md — add/remove from `skills/` pool only; ≤3 suggestions per round; URL/external file rejection enforced (SF-3).
- Dynamic install (F5) in WIZARD.md — installs from `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` pool; ADR-024 attribution injected as numbered step 1-2-3-4 BEFORE file write (SF-2).
- Dynamic `skills-as-prompts.md` generation in WIZARD.md Step 6 — generated from installed bundle, not copied from per-preset stub.
- Fallback legacy workspace paragraph in WIZARD.md (OQ-6).
- CI vocabulary gates (MF-1, MF-2) — `selection-presets.md` token-vocab gate + `curated-skills-registry.md` goal_tags gate. Rejects out-of-charset tokens.
- CI `POOL` loop — validates all `skills/*/SKILL.md` against 9-section template + 60-line floor.
- CI `CMP` assertion — byte-mirror check for all (preset, skill_bundle) pairs; ADR-018 exemption for study/research-synthesis.
- `docs/security-review-v2.4.md` — Phase 2 full security review (MF-1, MF-2, SF-1, SF-2, SF-3 findings).

### Changed
- WIZARD.md Q1: replaced 7-item force-map with open-ended goal discovery (F1/F2/F3).
- WIZARD.md Step 4: dynamic install from pool replaces static preset copy.
- WIZARD.md Step 6: dynamic generation from installed bundle.
- All 7 `examples/*/project-instructions-starter.txt`: Phase 1 section replaced with byte-identical 87-word compact Q1 block (Amendment A3).
- All 7 `examples/*/skills-as-prompts.md`: replaced with byte-identical 5-line deprecation stub (C-v2.4-4).
- `curated-skills-registry.md`: slug fix `email-drafter` → `email-drafting` (MF-2 compliance).
- CI `skill-depth-check` job: ENFORCED_EXAMPLES widened from 3 presets to all 7; POOL + CMP + MF-1 + MF-2 gates added.
- `docs/architecture.md`: ADR-024 thru ADR-028 + ADR Index backfill.
- `docs/spec.md`: v2.4 feature spec + architectural modifications.
- `docs/security-review.md`: v2.4 pointer entry.

### Notes
- `cowork.lock.json` unchanged (C-v2.4-2). Supply-chain integrity maintained.
- `CLAUDE.md` unchanged (C-v2.4-11). Word count ≤400.
- ADR-028 (external skill import) remains PROPOSED — implementation deferred to v2.5.

---

## [2.3.1] — 2026-05-08

### Changed
- Expanded 8 SKILL.md files from stub (18 lines) to production depth (~70–130 lines, 9-section structure):
  - `editing-pass` (writing)
  - `outline-generator` (writing)
  - `creative-brief` (creative)
  - `feedback-synthesizer` (creative)
  - `ideation-partner` (creative)
  - `email-drafting` (business-admin)
  - `follow-up-tracker` (personal-assistant)
  - `spend-awareness` (personal-assistant)
- All 8 files now match the canonical pattern set by `voice-matching`, `daily-briefing`, `meeting-notes`, `risk-assessment` (frontmatter with 4-bullet `trigger_examples`, 9-section body).

### Notes
- No new skills (curated-skills-registry.md cardinality unchanged at 22).
- No registry annotation moves.
- `action-items` and `doc-summary` remain `disposition: covered-by-runtime` (untouched per v2.3.0 W3).
- ADR-028 stays PROPOSED (implementation still deferred to v2.4).
- ENFORCED_EXAMPLES widening to writing/creative/business-admin/personal-assistant deferred to v2.4 hygiene cycle (CF-v2.3.1-A).

## [2.3.0] — 2026-05-08

**v2.3 — Top-2 Stub Expansion + ADR-028 Spec Scaffold**

### W1 — voice-matching SKILL.md depth expansion (writing preset)

- **voice-matching → full ADR-015 9-section depth (71 lines):** Replaces 18-line stub with complete skill: When to use, Triggers (4 bullets), Instructions (5 steps), Output format, Quality criteria, Anti-patterns (5 named anti-AI patterns), Example (input/output/meta-note), Writing-profile integration, Example prompts. Imperative-voice convention throughout (C-v2.3-7). 5 named anti-AI patterns: averaging to generic, ignoring samples, em-dash flood, hedged-language overuse, generic transitions (C-v2.3-3). Always consults `context/writing-profile.md` regardless of output length.

### W2 — daily-briefing SKILL.md depth expansion (personal-assistant preset)

- **daily-briefing → full ADR-015 9-section depth (100 lines):** Replaces 18-line stub with complete skill: When to use, Triggers (4 bullets mirroring PA global-instructions lines 16–18), Instructions (7 steps incl. proactive-offer confirmation gate + graceful-degradation ladder), Output format (4-section fixed schema: Intention/Priorities/Time blocks/Protect), Quality criteria, Anti-patterns, Example (vault state + intention questions + 4-section output), Writing-profile integration (tiered: Intention always; Priorities/blocks neutral), Example prompts. Graceful-degradation ladder: Calendar→Tasks→People→ask-user (C-v2.3-8).

### W3 — registry disposition annotations (curated-skills-registry.md)

- **doc-summary annotation:** `disposition: covered-by-runtime` blockquote immediately after doc-summary row. Reason: meeting-notes + Anthropic runtime DOCX/PDF skills + general Claude summarization are sufficient; no in-tree expansion planned.
- **action-items annotation:** `disposition: covered-by-runtime` blockquote immediately after action-items row. Reason: meeting-notes skill already extracts action items as a workflow step; no standalone in-tree expansion planned.
- CI cardinality grep count unchanged at 22 (annotations contain no `| builtin` or `| https://` patterns).

### W4 — ADR-028 PROPOSED spec scaffold (docs/architecture.md, landed at Phase 1)

- **ADR-028: `content_sha256` per-file integrity field for `cowork.lock.json`** (PROPOSED, implementation deferred to v2.4). Specifies: 64-char lowercase hex per-file content hash, optional on pre-v2.4 entries / required on new entries (option (c) new-entries-only migration), reader contract ("presence implies enforcement; absence implies tolerated"), JSON example, CI verification step prose for v2.4.

### W5 — orphan-item closeout

- Orphan commits `a7aa1cb` and `02bdf21` confirmed resolved on main per pipeline.md Phase 0 + Phase 1 rows. No file changes required.

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-08

**v2.2 — Carry-Forward Closeout + Skills Roadmap Discovery**

### W1 — Wizard Quality Fixes

- **D2 — Stopword filter in role-generation rule (WIZARD.md, AC-D2):** Extends AC-W2-9 verbatim-fallback with a 64-token STOPWORDS list. Description is lowercased, tokenized on non-alpha chars, stopwords stripped. Empty filtered token set fires the verbatim fallback unconditionally. Prevents placeholder-quality descriptions from generating unmoored role lines. Example: `description = "the a of"` → fallback fires.
- **D3 — SETUP-CHECKLIST.md migration annotation (AC-D3):** Adds "v2.1 migration complete — historical reference only" blockquote annotation to the `Upgrading from v2.0.x to v2.1.0` section. All original content retained for audit trail — no removal.
- **CFP — Objective field in personal-assistant starter profile (AC-CFP):** Appends `**Objective:** Stay on top of household, family, and personal logistics so nothing important falls through the cracks.` to `examples/personal-assistant/cowork-profile-starter.md` after the `**Goal preset:**` line. Format byte-matches WIZARD.md Step 1 output template per ADR-031.

### W2 — Skills Roadmap

- **docs/skills-roadmap.md (AC-RM-1..4):** New planning artifact for v2.3+ cycle. Three sections: (1) per-stub ROI scan — all 12 stubs receive a COVER-BY-RUNTIME / COVER-BY-EXTERNAL / EXPAND-IN-TREE / REMOVE verdict (9 EXPAND-IN-TREE, 2 COVER-BY-RUNTIME, 0 remove); (2) persona × JTBD coverage matrix — 20 JTBDs × 6 personas with FULL/PARTIAL/RUNTIME/EMPTY cells; (3) ranked v2.3+ candidates — voice-matching in-tree expansion (score 30), daily-briefing in-tree expansion (score 25), and contract-review external import from evolsb/claude-legal-skill (score 20) as top three.

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-07

**v2.1 — Objective-First FSM + Team-Composition Framing + Stub Markers + Symlink Removal**

### Added

- **Objective-first wizard FSM (ADR-029):** CLAUDE.md Phase 1 rewritten as "Phase 1 — Objective & Team". The wizard now opens with "What do you need help with? Tell me what you want this workspace to do for you — I'll assemble the right team." Three routing branches (fits one area / spans areas / novel) all emit named team members with objective-specific roles, not a category list.
- **WIZARD.md §Phase 1 Uncertainty Fallback (ADR-029):** New section inserted before the existing fallback — three angles (Learning / Shipping / Writing) for users who reply "not sure". Referenced by CLAUDE.md Phase 1 final line.
- **WIZARD.md §Phase 1 Role-Generation Rule (ADR-030, AC-W2-9):** Verbatim-fallback rule encoded: if a generated role line does not contain at least one keyword from the source skill's `description` field, fall back to verbatim `description` (truncated to ≤12 words).
- **Resume-after-interrupt with objective context (ADR-031):** WIZARD.md Fallback section rewritten to read `Objective:` from `cowork-profile.md`. v2.0.x profiles (no Objective field) trigger one extra question before resuming. Partial-install detection checks `<workspace>/.claude/skills/` for already-installed team members.
- **`cowork-profile.md` Objective field (ADR-031):** Optional `Objective:` line added to WIZARD.md Step 1 template, after `Goal preset:`. Absence in v2.0.x profiles is non-error (backward-compatible).
- **Stub depth markers (ADR-030):** `depth: stub` and `expansion: v2.2+` YAML frontmatter added to all 12 stub SKILL.md files: writing (editing-pass, outline-generator, voice-matching), creative (creative-brief, feedback-synthesizer, ideation-partner), business-admin (email-drafting, doc-summary, action-items), personal-assistant (daily-briefing, follow-up-tracker, spend-awareness).

### Changed

- **`presets/` symlink removed (ADR-032, ADR-026):** The `presets/` backward-compat symlink (pointing to `examples/`) is removed. `examples/` is the sole canonical path from v2.1.0. All CI, CONTRIBUTING.md, and SETUP-CHECKLIST.md references updated to `examples/`. Upgrade note in SETUP-CHECKLIST.md §Upgrading from v2.0.x.
- **CLAUDE.md word count:** 363 → 397 words (hard cap 400; 3-word buffer). Phase 1 block replaced (81 words → 115 words per ADR-029 verbatim contract).

### Documentation

- **ADR-028** (doc-only): Second trust anchor (content_sha256 pinned-digest) contract frozen for v2.2+ implementation.
- **ADR-033** (codified): Release-artifact completeness checklist (VERSION + CHANGELOG + README badge + Next-up teaser) as a mandatory single Phase 4 sub-step.

---

## [2.0.5] — 2026-05-07

**Chore release — first lock-populated release artifact.**

**Why:** v2.0.4 fixed the subshell scope bug (#28) that was preventing `cowork.lock.json` from populating, but the v2.0.4 release artifact was tagged BEFORE PR #31 merged the first real lock-population (110 files via `/sync-agency`). The v2.0.4 release ZIP shipped with `files: []` despite the code being correct. v2.0.5 re-tags from main HEAD so the release artifact reflects the fully-populated state.

**No code changes.** Identical to v2.0.4 except:
- `cowork.lock.json` now ships with 110 vetted upstream files (`pinned_commit_sha: 783f6a72bfd7f3135700ac273c619d92821b419a`, distributed across 10 categories: marketing 30, engineering 29, testing 8, sales 8, design 8, support 6, project-management 6, product 5, finance 5, academic 5)
- `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` reflects the same SHA
- VERSION + README badge bumped to 2.0.5

**For users:** Downloading v2.0.5.zip now gives a fully bootstrapped install. v2.0.4 still works but requires a `/sync-agency` dispatch first to populate the lock.

---

## [2.0.4] — 2026-05-06

**Hotfix — fetch loop subshell scope fix + allowlist alignment (#28).**

**Fixed:**
- **#28-A BLOCKER** — Replaced `echo "$CATEGORY_LISTING" | jq -r '...' | while read` pipe pattern with a JSONL accumulator pattern in `sync-agency.yml`. The pipe spawned a subshell; `NEW_FILES_JSON` mutations were invisible to the parent shell, producing `Files fetched: 0` and an empty `cowork.lock.json` regardless of upstream content. The accumulator writes one JSON line per file via `jq -nc --arg/--argjson` (no string interpolation — S1 mitigation), then composes the final array with `jq -s '.'` after the loop completes. Accumulator filename includes `${GITHUB_RUN_ID}` suffix to prevent cross-run `/tmp` collision (E3). `trap EXIT` cleanup prevents accumulator file leak on mid-run failure (E1).
- **#28-B BLOCKER** — Trimmed `.cowork-allowlist.json` `.allowed_categories` from 13 entries to the vetted 10-entry subset matching real upstream `agency-agents/specialized/` directories: `academic, design, engineering, finance, marketing, product, project-management, sales, support, testing`. Removed 6 phantom entries (`business, content-creation, customer-success, data-analysis, hr, legal`) that silently produced empty lock sections because no matching upstream directory exists.

**Added:**
- **JSONL accumulator regression gate** in `sync-agency-dry-run` CI job (`quality.yml` step 3). Fetches 2 sample files from `academic/`, builds a JSONL accumulator exactly as `sync-agency.yml` does, then asserts `jq -s '.' | length >= 1`. Catches subshell-class regressions at PR time before any sync-agency edit ships broken to main.

---

## [2.0.3] — 2026-05-07

**Hotfix — sync-agency authentication + dry-run CI gate.**

**Fixed:**
- **#25 BLOCKER** — Added `Authorization: bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}` to all `api.github.com` curl calls in `sync-agency.yml` (HEAD-SHA fetch + per-category content listing). Without auth, GitHub Actions runner anonymous-IP pool rate-limits caused `curl -sf` to fail silently, blocking the workflow at "Fetch upstream latest HEAD SHA". Authenticated calls use the 5000-req/hr pool. `raw.githubusercontent.com` calls do NOT require auth (separate pool, anonymous-friendly).

**Added:**
- **`sync-agency-dry-run` CI job** in `quality.yml` — runs on every PR that touches `sync-agency.yml`, the THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES template, the allowlist, or the lock file. Simulates the first three critical workflow steps (fetch HEAD SHA via auth, fetch LICENSE, content-scan regex compile-check) at PR time, catching auth/rate-limit/regex/structural BLOCKERs BEFORE merge instead of post-merge. Closes the 3-cycle pattern (v2.0 #12 YAML, v2.0.1 envsubst, v2.0.2 SPDX/regex, v2.0.3 #25 auth). Pinned with `permissions: { contents: read }` for fork-PR safety (S1 Phase 2 finding).

**Process improvement:**
- Pattern P3 (action SHA hallucination) and the new dry-run gate together close the post-merge BLOCKER recurrence pattern observed across v2.0.0 → v2.0.2.

---

## [2.0.2] — 2026-05-07

**Hardening Bundle — 10 security, compliance, and documentation fixes from v2.0/v2.0.1 carry-forward.**

**Fixed:**
- **#23 BLOCKER** — Corrected hallucinated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` SHA in `sync-agency.yml`. Previous SHA (271a8d0...) was not a real commit; replaced with verified v7.0.6 SHA (67ccf78...). Without this fix, the PR-creation step in `/sync-agency` fails silently.
- **#13** — Added per-file SPDX comparison step to `sync-agency.yml`. Reads OLD `.files[].spdx` from the pre-update lock file, compares to NEW entries from the fetch. If any SPDX field changes: adds `legal-review-required` label AND fails CI until @compliance acknowledges. Bootstrap-tolerant (skips when old lock has no `.files[]` entries). Closes ADR-022 compliance gap (v2.0 Phase 5 C8).
- **#14** — Created `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with Summary, Test plan, and Agency-Sync Checklist sections. Checklist (collapsible, agency-sync-only) requires lock file diff review, ≥3 file sample-audit per category, nexus-strategy.md absence check, SPDX acknowledgment, and 24h soak rule. Closes v2.0 Phase 6 A3 finding.
- **#15** — Added `verbatim-attribution-rule-check` job to `quality.yml`. Greps `CLAUDE.md` and `WIZARD.md` for the exact 4-sentence non-overridable attribution rule (ADR-024). Fails CI if the literal string is absent from either file. Closes G3 finding from v2.0 Phase 5.
- **#16** — Closed as superseded by ADR-027. ADR-027 (template extraction, v2.0.1) eliminates the heredoc delimiter surface that issue #16 proposed randomizing.
- **#17** — Changed fetch loop staging path from `/tmp/fetched-files/${filename}` to `/tmp/fetched-files/${category}/${filename}` with `mkdir -p` guard. Prevents filename collisions across categories. Closes A6 finding from v2.0 Phase 6.
- **#18** — Added `permissions: read-all` at workflow top level in `sync-agency.yml`. Job-level `contents: write, pull-requests: write` explicit grants remain. Closes A7 finding from v2.0 Phase 6.
- **#19** — Added Windows symlink note to `SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` explaining `presets/ → examples/` symlink behavior. Three workarounds documented: (a) Developer Mode, (b) `git clone -c core.symlinks=true`, (c) use `examples/` directly. Notes symlink removed in v2.1.0 (ADR-026). Closes A8 finding from v2.0 Phase 6.
- **#20** — ADR-023 amendment block recording live 13-category enumeration from `.cowork-allowlist.json` written to `docs/architecture.md` by @architect Phase 1. Closes v2.0 Phase 5 B2 (ADR-023 placeholder drift). Live categories: `academic`, `business`, `content-creation`, `customer-success`, `data-analysis`, `design`, `engineering`, `finance`, `hr`, `legal`, `marketing`, `product`, `support`.
- **#21** — Added `concurrency: { group: sync-agency, cancel-in-progress: false }` at workflow top level in `sync-agency.yml`. Prevents concurrent sync-agency runs; in-progress runs are preserved when a new push queues. Closes A4 finding from v2.0 Phase 6.
- **P3 baseline** — Extended `CONTRIBUTING.md` CI Workflow Quality Baseline with Check 3: every `uses:` SHA MUST be verified via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/refs/tags/<tag>` at Phase 5. Hallucinated SHAs are blocking. Codifies P3 pattern from v2.0 retrospective.

**YAML validation:** `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/sync-agency.yml'))"` and `yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/quality.yml'))` both pass.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-07

**Dynamic Workspace Architect — upstream content integration via msitarzewski/agency-agents.** Major supply-chain infrastructure: SHA-pinned lock file, fail-closed allowlist, monthly sync CI, prompt-injection content scan, attribution injection (ADR-024 full MIT block), THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md. All 8 Phase 2 MUST-FIX security items resolved. Presets relocated to `examples/` (v1.x symlink preserved for v2.0.x).

**Added:**
- `cowork.lock.json` — supply-chain lock file (ADR-020): pinned upstream SHA + per-file SHA-256 checksums. Bootstrap state: zero-SHA (populate via `/sync-agency`).
- `.cowork-allowlist.json` — fail-closed allowlist policy (ADR-023): 13 allowed categories, `nexus-strategy.md` permanently blocked, 9-entry `blocked_patterns` seed (nexus variants, orchestrator, meta-agent, pipeline-controller, the-council, cowork-orchestrator).
- `.github/workflows/sync-agency.yml` — hybrid cron (monthly) + manual dispatch; fetches upstream at pinned SHA; runs S1 8-pattern content-scan; updates lock file; regenerates `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`; opens PR labeled `agency-sync`; never auto-merges. All Action SHAs pinned (ADR-002).
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` — supply-chain files require maintainer sign-off (S2 MUST-FIX).
- `docs/security/upstream-content-scan-rules.md` — 8 prompt-injection detection patterns for upstream content (S1 CRITICAL MUST-FIX): ignore previous instructions, disregard, override, you are now/act as, new system instruction, forget the rules, pretend you have no, jailbreak/DAN/STAN.
- `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` — repo-level upstream copyright notices (ADR-025, L1-2 WARNING resolved). Regenerated by `/sync-agency` on every SHA bump.
- `examples/` — all 7 v1.x preset directories relocated here (byte-identical move, git blame preserved).
- `presets` symlink → `examples/` (v2.0.x deprecation alias; removed in v2.1).

**Changed:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — added `## Attribution (non-overridable, ADR-024)` section with S6 verbatim rule; category-discovery flow updated for upstream categories (academic, marketing, engineering, etc.); trimmed to 363 words.
- `WIZARD.md` — added `## Attribution Rule (non-overridable, ADR-024)` section with S6 verbatim rule; `presets/` → `examples/` path references updated.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — added Agency-Sync PR Review section: 2-approval rule (S2), 10-item reviewer checklist, 24h soak rule (S7), goal taxonomy keyword review (S10).
- `SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` — added trust-boundary disclosure (Open Issue #6); `presets/` → `examples/` path references.
- `README.md` — version badge 1.3.3 → 2.0.0; added supply-chain integrity section; trust-boundary disclosure (Open Issue #6); "Next up" → v2.1 Multi-Source Upstream; `presets/` → `examples/` references.
- `.github/workflows/quality.yml` — `ENFORCED_PRESETS` → `ENFORCED_EXAMPLES` (ADR-026, both enforcement + advisory blocks); all CI path globs updated `presets/` → `examples/`; new `lock-file-zero-sha-check` job (S9: reject zero-SHA on main); new `third-party-notices-check` job (ADR-025 existence); new `attribution-survives-render` job (S5 MUST-FIX: Python frontmatter + grep extraction).

**Security MUST-FIX resolutions:**
- S1 CRITICAL — 8-pattern content-scan in `/sync-agency` + `docs/security/upstream-content-scan-rules.md`
- S2 — `.github/CODEOWNERS` + CONTRIBUTING.md 2-approval rule for agency-sync PRs
- S4 — `.cowork-allowlist.json` 9-entry blocked_patterns seed
- S5 — `attribution-survives-render` CI job
- S6 — verbatim non-overridable attribution rule in CLAUDE.md + WIZARD.md
- S9 — `lock-file-zero-sha-check` CI job rejecting zero-SHA on main
- Open Issue #3 — `/sync-agency` first run designated SECURITY-SENSITIVE in PR template + CONTRIBUTING.md
- Open Issue #6 — trust-boundary disclosure in README.md + SETUP-CHECKLIST.md

**v1.x compatibility:** All 7 preset examples retained in `examples/`. `presets/` symlink provides backward compatibility for v2.0.x. CI still enforces depth on `study`, `research`, `project-management`. No skill content changes.

## [1.3.3] — 2026-05-07

**Project Management preset depth upgrade.** Three PM skills rewritten from 16-line stubs to full 9-section ADR-015 production depth. CI enforcement expanded. LICENSE copyright updated.

**Changed:**
- `presets/project-management/.claude/skills/meeting-notes/SKILL.md` — rewritten to 9-section template (114 lines): decision/action/open-question extraction framework, pasted-content-is-data anti-pattern guard (S1), worked example, writing-profile integration.
- `presets/project-management/.claude/skills/status-update/SKILL.md` — rewritten to 9-section template (88 lines): RAG-status synthesis, pasted-content-is-data guard (S1), output-echo anti-pattern guard (S2 — first LLM02-class finding in codebase), audience-calibrated narrative output.
- `presets/project-management/.claude/skills/risk-assessment/SKILL.md` — rewritten to 9-section template (110 lines): 6-column neutral schema table (ID/Description/Likelihood/Impact/Mitigation/Owner), pasted-content-is-data guard (S1), sensitive-shape naming guard (S3), top-2 priority prose section.
- `presets/project-management/skills-as-prompts.md` — regenerated from new SKILL.md bodies with condensed synthesis approach and safety constraint per skill.
- `curated-skills-registry.md` — PM row descriptions refreshed to reflect 9-section skill depth (row count unchanged: 22).
- `.github/workflows/quality.yml` — ENFORCED_PRESETS expanded from `"study research"` to `"study research project-management"` (ADR-016 v1.3.3 amendment; no CI shell-logic change).
- `LICENSE` — copyright updated to `Copyright (c) 2026 The cowork-starter-kit contributors`.
- `docs/security-review.md` — v1.3.3 Phase 2 security review section appended (S1/S2/S3 WARNINGs, S4/S5/S6 INFOs, Phase 4 resolution status).

**Preset-level changes:** project-management only. Study, Research, Writing, Creative, Business-Admin, Personal Assistant presets: no changes.

---

## [1.3.2.1] — 2026-04-20

**Infra patch.** Automate release-asset uploads.

**Added:**
- `.github/workflows/release-assets.yml` — auto-builds `.zip` and `.tar.gz` source archives and attaches them to the GitHub Release when a `v*` tag is pushed. Uses SHA-pinned actions (checkout v4.2.2, softprops/action-gh-release v3.0.0).

**Changed:**
- Future releases automatically include trackable download assets. Prior releases (v1.1.0–v1.3.2) were backfilled manually on 2026-04-20.

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-19

> **Note:** This release was initially tagged as v1.4.0 (2026-04-19) but was renamed to v1.3.2 to align with the v1.3.x preset-rollout versioning lane. Content is identical to the original v1.4.0 release.

**Personal Assistant Preset (7th preset) + Security Posture.** Adds a new goal preset for daily personal life management, introducing the first sensitive-personal-data surface in cowork-starter-kit history and the ADR-019 Data-Locality Rule pattern.

**Added:**

- 7th preset `presets/personal-assistant/` — full scaffold: README, folder-structure (Calendar/, Finances/, Tasks/, People/, Documents/), writing-profile, connector-checklist, context/ (5 files), project-instructions-starter.txt, cowork-profile-starter.md, skills-as-prompts.md
- 3 stub skills for Personal Assistant preset:
  - `presets/personal-assistant/.claude/skills/daily-briefing/SKILL.md` — 16-line stub; morning briefing from local Calendar/, Tasks/, People/ folders
  - `presets/personal-assistant/.claude/skills/follow-up-tracker/SKILL.md` — 16-line stub; logs commitments owed and pending from conversations and inbox
  - `presets/personal-assistant/.claude/skills/spend-awareness/SKILL.md` — 16-line stub; paste-based transaction summarizer; descriptive only (no investment advice, budgeting recommendations, or savings plans)
- ADR-019 "Instruction-Surface Security Posture" — 4-element contract for data-category constraints (exact heading, grep phrase, placement, setup-surface reinforcement); explicit scope limitation: NOT appropriate as sole control for regulated data (HIPAA PHI, PCI, GDPR Art. 9); bold callout block added to architecture.md per S7
- ADR-015 v1.3.2 amendment — Trigger 1 direct-invocation exempt from proactive-mapping requirement with global-instructions.md; codifies v1.3.1 Phase 6 implicit behavior
- Data Locality Rule in `presets/personal-assistant/global-instructions.md` — 6 sensitive-data categories (financial amounts, calendar events, contact details, health information, physical addresses, authentication credentials); decline-and-redirect rule; pasted-content-as-data rule; placed BEFORE proactive trigger rules per ADR-019
- New persona: Life Admin Juggler (v1.3.2 PRD)
- `presets/personal-assistant/connector-checklist.md` — finance paste-only prohibition with explicit naming of prohibited connectors (Plaid, Yodlee, bank APIs)
- S4 note in ADR-019 Consequences: redaction escape-valve scoped to PA preset in v1.3.2; community preset authors must revisit before broadening

**Changed:**

- `WIZARD.md` Q1 — Personal Assistant added as 7th goal option; Q3 — preset-specific question added for Personal Assistant; fallback message updated "6 options" → "7 options"
- `CLAUDE.md` — `personal-assistant` alias added to preset enumeration (350 words maintained via compensating trim of "sample" in Step 6 phrasing — non-semantic trim)
- `curated-skills-registry.md` — Personal Assistant section added; 3 new rows (daily-briefing, follow-up-tracker, spend-awareness); total 19 → 22 entries
- `README.md` — version badge 1.3.1 → 1.3.2; preset table updated to 7 presets; "Six goal presets" → "Seven goal presets"; Next up teaser updated
- `docs/security-review.md` — v1.3.2 Phase 2 security review appended (0 CRITICAL / 3 WARNING / 6 INFO; classification SECURITY-SENSITIVE; data-locality verdict ACCEPT WITH REFINEMENT; all 6 @architect open issues resolved)

**Security:**

- First SECURITY-SENSITIVE cycle since v1.2; first sensitive-personal-data surface in cowork-starter-kit history
- 9 MUST-FIX carry-forwards from Phase 2 absorbed: S1 (data-category extension), S2 (pasted-content-as-data rule), S3 (CLAUDE.md word-count preserved), S4 (ADR-019 S4 note), S5 (spend-awareness anti-pattern line), S6 (finance connector prohibition), S7 (ADR-019 scope bold callout), S8 (WIZARD.md "7 options"), Issue 5 (IP boundary grep — 0 hits confirmed)

---

## [1.3.1.1] — 2026-04-18

**Documentation patch.** No functional changes.

**Changed:**
- README.md version badge corrected 1.2.0 → 1.3.1 (stale since v1.3.0 release)
- README.md "Next up" teaser updated from shipped v1.3.0 to upcoming v1.3.2 Writing preset depth
- templates/skill-template/SKILL.md CONTRIBUTOR NOTICE block — removed stale "(arriving in v1.3.0 B2 commit)" future-tense reference; placeholder authoring rules are now live

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-18

**Research Preset Depth + Carry-Forward Hygiene** — rewrites all 3 Research preset skills to the full 9-section ADR-015 template, expands skill-depth CI enforcement to include the Research preset, and resolves all 3 Phase 2 v1.3.1 security carry-forwards.

**Added:**

- 3 Research preset skills rewritten to full depth:
  - `presets/research/.claude/skills/literature-review/SKILL.md` — thematic matrix + gap analysis framework; theme/source count header; 7 quality criteria; 7 anti-patterns; four-tier writing-profile rule (cells terse, count-line neutral, synthesis adapts, gaps adapt); BibTeX-aware extension
  - `presets/research/.claude/skills/source-analysis/SKILL.md` — 7-field evaluation card (source type, authority, methodology, evidence quality, limitations, bias, bottom line); citation recommendation as Bottom line; two-tier writing-profile rule (fields 1–6 terse, Bottom line adapts)
  - `presets/research/.claude/skills/research-synthesis/SKILL.md` — Research preset variant (ADR-018); always peer-review-rigor; 7-column matrix (claim, method, evidence, limitations, authority, recency, citation-network); four synthesis sections (Agreements, Disagreements, Gaps, Synthesis); four-tier writing-profile rule; intentionally distinct from Study variant
- `presets/research/skills-as-prompts.md` — regenerated from the 3 new Research SKILL.md files; replaces v1.0 stubs with full 9-section prose content for each skill; preserves ADR-003 dual-path fallback usability

**Changed:**

- `presets/research/global-instructions.md` — trigger rules expanded to cover all 4 modes per Research skill (literature-review: academic survey + thesis chapter; source-analysis: citation vetting + claim-specific evaluation; research-synthesis: peer-review prep + systematic review + meta-analysis framing)
- `curated-skills-registry.md` — Research preset descriptions updated to match v1.3.1 SKILL.md frontmatter; new `research-synthesis` Research entry added (ADR-018 dual-file; 19 total rows); vetting dates updated to 2026-04-18
- `.github/workflows/quality.yml` — `skill-depth-check` job: `ENFORCED_PRESETS` expanded from `"study"` to `"study research"`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — v1.3.1: B10 input-session template section added (full 6-Q schema, defaults+clarify pattern for skills 2+); After Phase 7 push-and-PR checklist added; PR reviewer checklist item 19 added (cross-preset slug-divergence check per ADR-018)
- `CLAUDE.md` — trimmed to 350 words (carry-forward from v1.2 audit A3; target met)

**Security (Phase 2 carry-forwards resolved):**

- S1 (MUST-FIX): CONTRIBUTING.md B10 section documents 3 worked-example authoring rules (real sources only; forbidden imperative token scan; user-written expected output); all 3 Research SKILL.md `## Example` sections cite real peer-reviewed sources (Miller 1956, Baddeley 2000, Cowan 2001) with no imperative tokens outside code fences
- S2 (SHOULD-FIX): CONTRIBUTING.md PR reviewer checklist item 19 added for cross-preset slug-divergence verification (ADR-018 enforcement by review, not CI)
- S3 (MUST-FIX): `presets/research/global-instructions.md` updated so all 4 trigger modes per Research skill map to "offer automatically when" firing conditions; `## Triggers` sections in B1/B2/B3 are a subset-or-extend of the updated global rules

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-18

**Preset Skills Depth — Study Preset Pilot** — rewrites all 3 Study preset skills to the full 9-section ADR-015 template, adds skill-depth CI enforcement, and resolves all 4 Phase 2 v1.3 security carry-forwards.

**Added:**

- 9-section skill template (ADR-015): `## When to use`, `## Triggers`, `## Instructions`, `## Output format`, `## Quality criteria`, `## Anti-patterns`, `## Example`, `## Writing-profile integration`, `## Example prompts` — enforced via CI for the Study preset pilot
- `skill-depth-check` CI job (ADR-016): validates each Study preset skill has all 9 required section headings and meets the 60-line floor; path allowlist prevents false positives on non-skill files
- 3 Study preset skills rewritten to full depth:
  - `presets/study/.claude/skills/flashcard-generation/SKILL.md` — Anki-ready output with human-readable + TSV blocks, 6 quality criteria, 6 anti-patterns, writing-profile integration, spaced-repetition atomicity rules
  - `presets/study/.claude/skills/note-taking/SKILL.md` — 4-framework auto-selection (Cornell / Outline / Zettelkasten / Lightweight), 11-step instructions, 7 quality criteria, 7 anti-patterns, 3-tier writing-profile rule
  - `presets/study/.claude/skills/research-synthesis/SKILL.md` — source-count mode auto-selection (1/2/≥3), full matrix + synthesis output, BibTeX-aware extension, 7 quality criteria, 7 anti-patterns
- Retro-template carry-forward workflow (B8): `docs/retro.md` v1.3.0 section added with carry-forward surfacing process
- README "Next up" teaser (B9): `## Next up` section added describing v1.4 Research preset pilot
- CONTRIBUTING.md v1.3: checklist items 12–17 added (skill-depth-check CI requirements); placeholder-authoring rules: 5 rules stating when placeholder content is acceptable (no undeclared gaps, examples must be real)
- `.gitignore` guard: patterns added for `.claude/projects/` and `skill-inputs/` directories to prevent accidental commit of local pipeline state and user skill-input files (S4 carry-forward)

**Changed:**

- `curated-skills-registry.md`: Study preset descriptions updated to match v1.3.0 SKILL.md frontmatter (`description:` field) for all 3 entries; vetting dates updated to 2026-04-18
- `presets/study/skills-as-prompts.md`: regenerated from the three v1.3.0 SKILL.md files; replaces 16-line v1.2 stubs with full 9-section prose content for each skill; preserves ADR-003 dual-path fallback usability as a single pasteable prompt
- `.github/workflows/quality.yml` `registry-url-check` job: tightened URL validation to require `https://github.com/` prefix for non-builtin entries (was any HTTPS URL)

**Security (Phase 2 carry-forwards resolved):**

- S1: CI advisory notice added — `skill-depth-check` job comments warn when a skill file is near the CI floor; CONTRIBUTING.md v1.3 documents the fail-open rationale
- S2: CONTRIBUTING.md v1.3 item 16 added: SHA-pin all GitHub Action versions before publishing community skills
- S3: Inline negative test added to `skill-depth-check` CI job: verifies the check correctly rejects a synthetic 59-line stub
- S4: `.gitignore` guard added for `skill-inputs/` and `.claude/projects/` — prevents local user input files from being committed to the public repo
