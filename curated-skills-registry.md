## Adding a Registry Entry

1. Fork the repo and add your entry to the appropriate section in this file
2. `source_url` must be `https://` (HTTPS only) — `http://` URLs are not accepted
3. For GitHub entries: pin `source_url` to a specific commit SHA, not a branch URL
   - Example: `https://github.com/org/repo/blob/a1b2c3d4e5f6/SKILL.md`
4. `vetting_date` is the date you personally tested the skill in a live Cowork session
5. Include a brief vetting summary in your PR description (stars, last commit, keyword scan result)
6. Open a PR with title `feat: add <skill-name> to curated-skills-registry`

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full PR checklist.
