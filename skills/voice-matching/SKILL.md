## When to use

Consult voice-matching whenever Cowork must produce content of any length where the user's voice should be preserved — drafts, article intros, newsletter sections, posts, or any text the user will publish under their name. This skill is the runtime implementation of the writing-profile (ADR-013): it reads `context/writing-profile.md` and applies named patterns from the user's samples. Voice-matching is distinct from editing-pass (which improves an existing draft) and outline-generator (which structures content without voicing it).

## Triggers

- User says "write this in my voice", "use my voice", "match my style", or names this skill directly.
- User shares writing samples or pastes work they've written previously.
- User asks for content that "sounds like me", "in my voice", or "in my style".
- User requests a draft and a writing-profile.md, Voice-and-Style/ folder, or Published/ folder is present in the project.

## Instructions

1. **Read available samples.** Check `Voice-and-Style/` first, then `Published/`, then any sample pasted in the message. If no samples are available, ask the user to paste at least one paragraph before proceeding. Do NOT generate in a default voice — see anti-pattern bullet 2 below.
2. **Identify named voice patterns from the samples.** For each sample, extract: (a) sentence length distribution (short/medium/long ratio); (b) vocabulary register (casual/conversational/formal/literary); (c) structural habits (short paragraphs / numbered lists / subheadings / no subheadings); (d) signature elements (em-dash density, sentence-starting conjunctions like "And"/"But", contractions, parenthetical asides). State each pattern by name in working notes (not in the user output).
3. **Apply the identified patterns to the new content.** Match the observed pattern by name — not "approximately professional clear writing". For each named voice pattern from step 2, verify the new content matches before presenting.
4. **Produce the meta-note.** After the content, add exactly one sentence naming the specific voice choices made (e.g., "Voice choices: short paragraphs, em-dashes used at sample density (~1 per 80 words), and contractions throughout — matching your Published/2025-09 sample.").
5. **Consult `context/writing-profile.md` always.** Per ADR-013 and the architecture stress-test, voice-matching is the primary writing-profile implementation. Read `context/writing-profile.md` if it exists; surface conflicts between the writing-profile and the named patterns from step 2 by stating the conflict in the meta-note and asking the user which to prioritize.

## Output format

Plain prose in the chat. New content first, then exactly one meta-note line at the end. No JSON, no YAML, no Obsidian wikilinks. Output is portable across Obsidian, Notion, Apple Notes, plain-text editors, and email/messaging clients.

## Quality criteria

1. At least two named voice idiosyncrasies from the sample are preserved (named in the meta-note).
2. Meta-note is present, exactly one sentence, names specific voice choices (not "I matched your voice").
3. Sentence-length distribution is within ~20% of the dominant pattern in the samples (terse/medium/long ratio).
4. No anti-AI tics (em-dash flood, hedged-language overuse, generic transitions per `## Anti-patterns`) unless the sample itself uses them.
5. Vocabulary register matches the sample (no upgrade to literary register if the sample is conversational).

## Anti-patterns

- **Averaging samples to generic clear writing** — collapsing observed sample idiosyncrasies into "professional clear prose" that loses the user's voice.
- **Ignoring existing samples** — generating in a default register when samples are present in `Voice-and-Style/`, `Published/`, or pasted in the message.
- **Em-dash flood** — overusing em-dashes (—) as a stylistic tic regardless of whether the sample uses them. Match sample em-dash density, do not impose AI-default density.
- **Hedged-language overuse** — packing the output with "perhaps", "it could be argued", "this might suggest", "in some sense" when the sample is direct and assertive. Match sample hedge frequency.
- **Generic transitions** — using "moreover", "furthermore", "in conclusion", "additionally" where the sample uses contractions, sentence fragments, or paragraph breaks. Match sample transition style.

## Example

**Input — user writing sample (~5 lines):**

> The research is clear. Short meetings beat long ones, not because people are lazy but because focus degrades fast. I've sat through enough two-hour reviews to know the moment the room checks out — it's around minute forty. Cut the meeting in half, keep the same decision.

**Task:** Write a 100-word intro for an article on remote work focus.

**Output:**

Remote work doesn't kill focus — back-to-back meetings do. The research backs this up. Cognitive load peaks fast, and once it spills over, the rest of the day is cleanup. What actually works is protecting a 90-minute uninterrupted block in the morning: phone on silent, Slack on pause, one task open. Not sexy. Not a system. Just time you don't let anyone else schedule. Do that consistently and remote work stops feeling like a productivity deficit — it starts feeling like an advantage.

*Voice choices: short declarative sentences (~8–12 words), em-dashes used at sample density (~1 per 3 sentences), no hedging, paragraph-break transitions matching sample style.*

## Writing-profile integration

Voice-matching ALWAYS consults `context/writing-profile.md` regardless of output length. This skill is the primary runtime implementation of the writing-profile — the "consult on 100+ words" threshold in `examples/writing/global-instructions.md` does NOT apply here; voice-matching reads the profile unconditionally. If the writing-profile and the observed sample patterns conflict (e.g., profile says "avoid em-dashes" but samples use them heavily), surface the conflict in the meta-note and defer to the user.

## Example prompts

- "Read my Voice-and-Style/ folder and write a 200-word intro for an article on [topic]."
- "Write a LinkedIn post in my voice about [topic]."
- "Here's an example of my writing: [paste]. Now write an opening paragraph in the same style."
