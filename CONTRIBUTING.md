# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to Claude Cowork Config. This guide explains how to add a new preset.

---

## Adding a new preset

All contributions start from the template. Do not create a preset folder from scratch.

1. Copy `templates/preset-template/` to `presets/<your-preset-name>/`
2. Use a lowercase, hyphenated slug for the folder name (e.g. `legal`, `data-science`, `teaching`)
3. Fill in every file — no placeholders left blank
4. Run the CI checks locally before opening a PR (see below)
5. Open a pull request with the title `feat: add <preset-name> preset`

## PR review checklist for maintainers

Before merging a new preset PR, verify all 11 items:

- [ ] **`project-instructions-starter.txt` present** — file exists at `presets/<name>/project-instructions-starter.txt`
- [ ] **Starter file is ≤350 words** — run `wc -w presets/<name>/project-instructions-starter.txt` to confirm (raised from ≤300 in v1.2 for dynamic wizard branching)
- [ ] **Safety rule present verbatim in starter file** — must contain: "Always ask for explicit confirmation before deleting, moving, or overwriting any file or folder."
- [ ] **All skills in `folder/SKILL.md` format** — no flat `.md` skill files at `presets/<name>/.claude/skills/` root; each skill is a folder with `SKILL.md` containing valid YAML frontmatter (`name:` and `description:` fields)
- [ ] **Minimum file count met** — at least 3 skills in `.claude/skills/`, at least 2 context files in `context/`, at least 1 `folder-structure.md`, at least 1 `connector-checklist.md`
- [ ] **"Try this now" prompts present** — `skills-as-prompts.md` includes at least one file-based and one file-agnostic example prompt
- [ ] **CI passes** — all GitHub Actions jobs pass: markdown lint, link check, shellcheck, safety-rule grep, starter-file-check, starter-safety-rule-check, skill-format-check, writing-profile-template-check
- [ ] **`writing-profile.md` present** — file exists at `presets/<name>/context/writing-profile.md` with non-placeholder content in Tone & Voice and Anti-AI Guidance sections; must not be blank or contain only `[bracketed placeholders]`
- [ ] **`curated-skills-registry.md` entry follows schema** — if the PR adds skills to `curated-skills-registry.md`, each entry must include: `name`, `description`, `source_url` (HTTPS only or `builtin`), `vetting_date` (ISO 8601), `tier` (1 or 2), `goal_tags`. PR description must include vetting evidence (source repo stars/health, last commit date, keyword scan result showing no flagged terms)
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md sync** — if the PR modifies the wizard flow in any `project-instructions-starter.txt`, `CLAUDE.md` must be updated to match (and vice versa). All 7 wizard surfaces (CLAUDE.md + 6 starter files) must stay in sync. PRs that touch one must touch all.
- [ ] **No `Sample:` or `Raw sample:` field** — `writing-profile.md` files must not store raw user writing samples; wizard instructions must extract patterns only
- [ ] **Prior retro carry-forwards reviewed** — per `docs/retro-template.md` §Carry-Forward Review; every item from the previous cycle's Section 8 must have an explicit disposition before this PR closes

## CLAUDE.md changes — high-impact notice

`CLAUDE.md` is auto-loaded as system context for any user who opens this repo folder in Cowork. It is a universal entry point — changes to it affect all users immediately, not just users of a specific preset.

**PRs that modify `CLAUDE.md` must:**

1. Also update all 6 `presets/*/project-instructions-starter.txt` files to match (wizard flow must stay in sync — ADR-010)
2. Include a clear explanation of what changed and why in the PR description
3. Be reviewed by a maintainer before merge — treat `CLAUDE.md` edits as security-relevant changes

Similarly: PRs that modify wizard flow in any starter file must also update `CLAUDE.md`.

## Registry entries — `curated-skills-registry.md`

When adding entries to `curated-skills-registry.md`:

- `source_url` must use HTTPS (not `http://`). Use `builtin` only for Anthropic official skills — do not claim `builtin` for community-sourced skills.
- **Pin to a specific commit SHA**, not a branch URL, to prevent URL rotation attacks:
  - Correct: `https://github.com/org/repo/blob/a1b2c3d4e5f6/path/SKILL.md`
  - Avoid: `https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/path/SKILL.md`
- `vetting_date` is the date you personally tested the specific SHA above
- Include vetting evidence in your PR description: source repo stars, last commit date, keyword scan result

The Tier 2 community skill search list in `WIZARD.md` is maintained by repo maintainers. Do not submit PRs that add new repos to that list — open an issue to request additions.

## Skill content safety

Before submitting any skill content from external sources, scan it at [SkillRisk.org](https://skillrisk.org). Do not submit skill content that was not written by you or sourced from Anthropic's official materials.

## Running CI checks locally

```bash
# Markdown lint
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"

# ShellCheck (requires shellcheck installed)
shellcheck scripts/setup-folders.sh

# Safety rule grep — global-instructions.md
SAFETY_RULE="Always ask for explicit confirmation before deleting"
for f in presets/*/global-instructions.md; do
  if ! grep -q "$SAFETY_RULE" "$f"; then
    echo "MISSING safety rule: $f"
  fi
done

# Safety rule grep — starter files (.txt)
for f in presets/*/project-instructions-starter.txt; do
  if ! grep -q "$SAFETY_RULE" "$f"; then
    echo "MISSING safety rule: $f"
  fi
done

# Starter file existence check
for preset in study research writing project-management creative business-admin; do
  if [ ! -f "presets/$preset/project-instructions-starter.txt" ]; then
    echo "MISSING starter file: presets/$preset/project-instructions-starter.txt"
  fi
done

# Skill format check — no flat .md files at skills root
for skills_dir in presets/*/.claude/skills; do
  for f in "$skills_dir"/*.md; do
    if [ -f "$f" ]; then
      echo "FLAT SKILL FILE: $f (must be in folder/SKILL.md format)"
    fi
  done
done
```

## Version management

Do not modify the `VERSION` file or `CHANGELOG.md`. Maintainers handle versioning at release time. Your PR should contain only files in `presets/<your-preset-name>/`.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All contributions must be signed off with `git commit -s` (Developer Certificate of Origin). By signing off, you certify that you wrote the contribution or have the right to submit it.
