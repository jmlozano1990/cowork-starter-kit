# Selection Presets

> Curated skill combinations used as starting suggestions by the dynamic wizard (F3). Not a locked menu — every preset is editable in F4 and the user can request a custom-from-scratch composition (F3 Path C) at any point.

These blocks are parsed by the wizard using line-scanning (`^```preset$` / `^```$` fences). Each block's `core_skills`, `optional_skills`, and `match_signals` values are comma-separated lowercase tokens. Key order is fixed per C-v2.4-1 (updated v2.6.0). The `cross_cutting_skills:` annotation block at the bottom of this file is pool-level (not per-preset) and is parsed as a single comma-separated list under the `cross_cutting_skills:` line.

## Cross-Cutting Skills (pool-level annotation)

These skills are useful across multiple presets. They are NOT installed by default for any preset — the wizard offers them on-demand at runtime via the "Skill swap" affordance in each preset's `global-instructions.md` (per ADR-034 §Decision and D8 — instruction-only swap; no file copy).

```cross_cutting
cross_cutting_skills: action-items, meeting-notes, doc-summary, voice-matching, research-synthesis
```

| Skill | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| action-items | Used situationally by PM, business-admin, personal-assistant, and study personas |
| meeting-notes | Used situationally by PM, business-admin, and personal-assistant personas |
| doc-summary | Used situationally by research, business-admin, and personal-assistant personas |
| voice-matching | Used situationally by writing and creative personas; crossover to business-admin for exec emails |
| research-synthesis | Bridges study, research, and writing domains |
