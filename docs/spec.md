## Strategic Context

v2.5 is a v3.0 gate-prep cycle. The decision memo (internal, Council-side) recommends deferring the full Model C Hybrid pivot to v3.0 and shipping v2.5 as a focused structural seam-layer. Three v3.0 triggers are encoded as ACs below; all three must be green before `/spec v3.0` is invoked.

**Binding carry-forwards this cycle:** CF-v2.4-A, -B, -D (re-deferred), -E (re-deferred), -F, -G.

---

## Problem

v2.4 shipped the Dynamic Workspace Architect — a complete end-to-end wizard with goal routing, pool-based install, and CI vocabulary gates. Four structural gaps survived as deferred carry-forwards and continue to accumulate cycle cost:

1. **ADR-028 (PROPOSED since v2.3.0):** `cowork.lock.json` records per-file `sha256` at fetch time but does NOT verify that hash on subsequent syncs. If an upstream file is silently replaced between pinned commits (a poisoned-fetch scenario), `sync-agency.yml` will import modified content without detection. This is a supply-chain integrity gap that has been deferred three times.

2. **`tools:` frontmatter absent:** SKILL.md files have no machine-readable signal for which agentic tool each skill targets. The wizard cannot make tool-aware recommendations. As Cowork grows toward multi-tool reach (Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf — v3.0 scope), the absence of `tools:` becomes a blocker. Adding it now is a low-risk seam that enables v3.0 without requiring a rework cycle.

3. **CI hardening gap (CF-v2.4-B + CF-v2.4-G):** MF-1/MF-2 `grep -c || true` masking can silently pass on empty awk pipeline output. MF-2 awk uses positional `$7` rather than header-name lookup — column reordering in `curated-skills-registry.md` breaks the gate silently. Both gaps are non-exploitable in v2.4 (upstream checks catch structural failure first) but represent preventable false-pass scenarios.

4. **No upstream contribution signal:** v3.0 Model C Hybrid requires confidence that the upstream community will engage with Cowork contributions. Without a test PR, this is a pure assumption. One contribution PR (small scope, clean format, project-management category) establishes the relationship and starts the 60-day acknowledgment clock.

5. **P-COWORK-1 (4-cycle carry):** Local markdownlint configuration is absent. Contributors run locally, CI catches failures post-push. A pre-commit hook closes this gap.

## Target Users

**Primary: Alex — University Student (20, biochemistry)**
v2.5 gain: `tools:` frontmatter tells the wizard Alex is on Claude Code — skill recommendations stay relevant without multi-tool confusion from future Copilot/Cursor skills added to the pool.

**Secondary: Maria — Knowledge Worker (35, research analyst)**
v2.5 gain: Per-file integrity verification means the `meeting-notes` skill Maria installs is byte-verified against the pinned upstream commit. Silent content tampering is detected before install.

**Tertiary: Sam — The Creator (28, freelance writer)**
v2.5 gain: Unblocked; v2.5 is infrastructure. Sam sees no surface-level change.

**New contributor**
v2.5 gain: `scripts/install-pre-commit.sh` + CONTRIBUTING.md instructions give contributors the same markdownlint gate as CI locally, reducing surprise CI failures.

## Core Features (MVP)

### F1 — ADR-028 Implementation: `content_sha256` Per-File Integrity Field

**What it does:** Adds a `content_sha256` field to each `files[]` entry in `cowork.lock.json`. On every `sync-agency.yml` execution (both auto-sync and PR-triggered), the workflow fetches each pinned-commit file, computes its SHA-256, and compares it to the stored `content_sha256`. A mismatch fails the workflow with `::error::` and blocks merge.

**Why now:** ADR-028 has been PROPOSED-not-implemented since v2.3.0 (three deferrals). The field `sha256` already exists in `cowork.lock.json` per-file entries and is populated at fetch time by `sync-agency.yml` lines 216-243. The gap is that `sync-agency.yml` never verifies against the stored value on subsequent fetches — it only writes. This feature closes that gap.

**Scope:**
- Add `content_sha256` field to all existing `files[]` entries in `cowork.lock.json` (initial values computed from currently-fetched content at pinned commit `783f6a72`).
- Extend `sync-agency.yml` verify step: after fetching each file, compute SHA-256 of fetched content and compare to `cowork.lock.json` `content_sha256`. Fail step on mismatch.
- Update ADR-028 status from PROPOSED to ACCEPTED in `docs/architecture.md` with implementation record.
- CI fault-injection test: a `.github/workflows/` fixture or quality.yml step that verifies the check fires correctly when a file's content is poisoned (mutated byte in the fetched content vs. stored hash). The fault-injection must produce a non-zero exit.

**Preservation constraint:** `cowork.lock.json` schema version stays `"1.0"` — `content_sha256` is an additive field, not a breaking change. ADR-020 lock contract semantics are preserved.

**ACs:**
- **AC-F1-1:** `cowork.lock.json` contains a `content_sha256` field on every entry in the `files[]` array. `grep -c '"content_sha256"' cowork.lock.json` equals the number of entries in `files[]`.
- **AC-F1-2:** `sync-agency.yml` contains a verify step that fetches each pinned-commit file and compares its computed SHA-256 to the `content_sha256` stored in `cowork.lock.json`. Grep confirms: `grep -c "content_sha256" .github/workflows/sync-agency.yml` >= 2 (read step + verify step).
- **AC-F1-3:** Fault-injection test fires: when any single `content_sha256` value in the fixture is mutated to a wrong hash and `sync-agency.yml` verify runs against it, the step exits non-zero. Fault injection documented in `docs/architecture.md` ADR-028 implementation record.
- **AC-F1-4 (zero-diff):** `cowork.lock.json` `$schema_version` remains `"1.0"`. `jq -r '."$schema_version"' cowork.lock.json` = `1.0`. ADR-020 lock contract schema version unchanged.
- **AC-F1-5 (zero-diff):** `sync-agency.yml` SCAN_PATTERNS block (lines 143+220) byte-unchanged from v2.4 HEAD. `cmp` exit 0 on lines 143 and 220 before and after the PR.

---

### F2 — `tools:` SKILL.md Frontmatter Field

**What it does:** Adds an optional `tools:` YAML frontmatter field to every SKILL.md in `skills/`. Declares which agentic tools the skill's content is known to work with. Default when absent: `[claude-code]`. CI validates token vocabulary against an explicit allow-list.

**Vocabulary (closed at v2.5):** `claude-code`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `windsurf`. No other tokens are permitted. Wizard reads the field as informational at v2.5. Tool-aware routing is v3.0 scope.

**Why the closed vocabulary matters:** The allow-list locks down tool names at this layer. If a skill author writes `copilot-chat` or `github-copilot`, CI rejects it. This prevents vocabulary drift that would require a rework sweep at v3.0.

**Scope:**
- Add `tools:` field to all 20 SKILL.md files in `skills/`. All 20 receive `tools: [claude-code]` as the v2.5 default (reflecting current validated support).
- Add CI vocabulary gate (new step in `quality.yml`): validate `tools:` field in every `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter against the allow-list `[claude-code, copilot, cursor, windsurf]`. Unknown tokens fail CI.
- New ADR in `docs/architecture.md` documenting the `tools:` field contract, vocabulary allow-list, default rule, and v3.0 routing intent.

**Preservation constraint:** `tools:` is an additive frontmatter field. ADR-007 (Skill File Format) receives an amendment block. Existing SKILL.md 9-section body structure is unchanged (ADR-015 preserved). No pool count change (still 20 skills).

**ACs:**
- **AC-F2-1:** All 20 SKILL.md files contain a `tools:` frontmatter field. `grep -rl "^tools:" skills/ | wc -l` = 20.
- **AC-F2-2:** All 20 skills have `tools:` set to `[claude-code]` at v2.5. `grep -c "tools: \[claude-code\]" skills/*/SKILL.md` = 20.
- **AC-F2-3:** CI vocabulary gate present in `quality.yml`. New step name contains `tools` or `tools-vocab`. Gate fails on invalid token: fault-inject `tools: [unknown-tool]` into any SKILL.md fixture → CI exits non-zero.
- **AC-F2-4:** New ADR documented in `docs/architecture.md` with: (a) field name `tools:`, (b) closed vocabulary list, (c) default-when-absent rule, (d) v3.0 routing intent marked explicitly. `grep -c "tools:" docs/architecture.md` >= 4 (ADR title + field name + vocabulary + default rule).
- **AC-F2-5 (zero-diff):** Skill pool count unchanged: `ls skills/ | wc -l` = 20. ADR-015 9-section body structure preserved: skill-depth-check passes on all 20 skills.

### F3 — First Upstream Contribution PR

**What it does:** Submits ONE Cowork-original skill to an upstream community skills repository as a PR in the upstream flat persona-centric format. Tracks the acknowledgment outcome. Starts the 60-day v3.0 trigger clock.

**Upstream contribution candidate: `meeting-notes`**

Rationale for `meeting-notes` over alternatives:
- Lowest Cowork-specific entanglement: 1 optional writing-profile reference (line 108, contextual — easily stripped for upstream format). `risk-assessment` (2 refs) and `status-update` (2 refs) have more entanglement.
- Maps to the upstream's `project-management/` category — clean landing zone.
- Universal utility: meeting-notes extraction is tool-agnostic and persona-agnostic. The upstream community benefits broadly.
- 114 lines in Cowork format → reformatted to upstream flat persona-centric format (~60-80 lines estimated). Within one-cycle scope for manual rewrite.
- No Data Locality Rule (ADR-019) or wizard-runtime dependencies — safe to decouple from Cowork infrastructure.

**Format bridge (manual rewrite required — not scriptable):**
The upstream format is persona-centric (identity + capabilities + workflow + deliverables). Cowork's format is procedural (instructions + triggers + output + quality + anti-patterns + example). This requires a structural rewrite, not a text transformation. @dev authors the upstream-format version from scratch using the Cowork skill's content as the source of truth for substance.

**Upstream format target:**
```
---
name: Meeting Notes Specialist
description: [one-line]
tools: Read, Write, Edit
color: blue
emoji: [emoji]
vibe: [personality hook]
---
# Meeting Notes Specialist
## [Identity section]
## [Core Mission section]
## [Critical Rules section]
## [Technical Deliverables section]
## [Workflow Process section]
## [Communication Style section]
## [Learning and Memory section]
## [Success Metrics section]
```

**Cowork attribution survival:** The upstream PR description (not the skill file body) attributes Cowork as the source. The skill file itself follows upstream's format conventions — no Cowork-specific attribution block injected (ADR-024 applies to wizard install, not upstream contributions). @compliance confirms attribution survival approach at Phase 2 `/legal`.

**Output deliverables:**
1. `upstream-contribution/meeting-notes-upstream.md` — upstream-format version of the skill, committed to the Cowork repo as a tracked artifact. This is the file submitted as a PR to the upstream community repo.
2. CHANGELOG v2.5.0 entry records the PR URL once opened (format: `Upstream contribution: [PR URL] — meeting-notes skill submitted to project-management category`).
3. `docs/architecture.md` records the PR URL and open date under a new implementation note.

**v3.0 trigger clock starts:** PR open date recorded. 60-day acknowledgment window begins. Result feeds v3.0 gate review.

**Re-defer rationale (CF-v2.4-D):** CF-v2.4-D (preset community PR contribution workflow) is explicitly re-deferred to v2.6+. Rationale: F3 is the upstream relationship test. If F3 returns a signal (acknowledged/merged/rejected), v2.6 scopes the community workflow with evidence. If F3 returns silence, community PR workflow has no upstream benefit to enable.

**ACs:**
- **AC-F3-1:** `upstream-contribution/meeting-notes-upstream.md` exists in the repo at v2.5.0 HEAD. File uses upstream flat persona-centric YAML frontmatter (fields: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `color`, `emoji`, `vibe`) and 8-section persona body. `grep -c "^---" upstream-contribution/meeting-notes-upstream.md` = 2 (open and close frontmatter fences).
- **AC-F3-2:** CHANGELOG v2.5.0 section contains a line starting with `Upstream contribution:` followed by the PR URL. `grep -c "Upstream contribution:" CHANGELOG.md` >= 1.
- **AC-F3-3:** `upstream-contribution/meeting-notes-upstream.md` does NOT contain Cowork-specific terms: `grep -ciE "WIZARD|ADR-|cowork\.lock|selection-preset|skill-depth|sync-agency|writing-profile" upstream-contribution/meeting-notes-upstream.md` = 0.
- **AC-F3-4:** PR URL recorded in `docs/architecture.md` under the F3 implementation note. `grep -c "agency-agents/pull/" docs/architecture.md` >= 1.
- **AC-F3-5 (v3.0 trigger):** PR opened and URL is a valid GitHub PR URL (format `https://github.com/[owner]/[repo]/pull/[N]`). @qa verifies at Phase 5 that the URL returns HTTP 200 or 3xx — not by verifying PR state (open/merged/closed).

**v3.0 trigger encoding (informational — not blocking ACs for v2.5):**
The three v3.0 gates (to be evaluated after v2.5 ships):
1. Upstream PR acknowledged (reviewed, merged, or constructive feedback) within 60 days of open date.
2. Upstream still active (last commit within 90 days of gate review date).
3. v2.5 CI clean (all checks green, 0 CRITICAL/WARNING findings in Phase 6 audit).

These gates are not ACs for v2.5 (they are prospective). They are recorded here for the v3.0 spec author.

### F4 — MF-1/MF-2 grep-c Hardening + MF-2 awk Column Fix

**What it does:** Bundles CF-v2.4-B and CF-v2.4-G. Two targeted hardening changes to `quality.yml`:

**Change 1 (CF-v2.4-G):** Replace `grep -c ... || true` masking in MF-1 and MF-2 steps with an explicit empty-pipeline assertion. The `|| true` pattern causes `BAD` to be empty (not `0`) when `grep` finds no matches on an empty pipeline, and `${BAD:-0}` silently defaults to 0. Replace the pattern with either:
- `set -o pipefail` before the pipeline, OR
- An explicit post-pipeline check: `if [ -z "${BAD}" ]; then BAD=0; fi` (explicit, readable, no pipefail side effects elsewhere).

**Change 2 (CF-v2.4-B):** Replace positional `$7` in the MF-2 awk expression with a column-name-based lookup. Current: `awk -F'|' '/^\| / && NR>2 { print $7 }'`. Replace with: awk reads the header row (NR==2), maps column name `goal_tags` to its column index, then uses that index for data rows. If `goal_tags` column is not found in the header, the gate must exit non-zero (fail-closed) rather than silently pass.

**Regression test fixture:** A CI step or test fixture that verifies MF-2 fires correctly when `goal_tags` column is reordered. Fixture: a `curated-skills-registry.md` copy with columns in a different order → gate must still find `goal_tags` by name and apply the vocabulary check.

**ACs:**
- **AC-F4-1:** MF-1 step in `quality.yml` no longer contains `|| true` on the `grep -c` line. Replaced with explicit empty-check or `set -o pipefail`.
- **AC-F4-2:** MF-2 step in `quality.yml` no longer contains `|| true` on the `grep -c` line. Same verification as AC-F4-1 for MF-2 step context.
- **AC-F4-3:** MF-2 awk expression uses column-name lookup, not positional `$7`. `grep -c '\$7' .github/workflows/quality.yml` = 0 (no positional `$7` references remain in quality.yml).
- **AC-F4-4:** MF-2 awk contains a header-scan clause: `grep -c "goal_tags" .github/workflows/quality.yml` >= 2 (header-scan definition + usage). If `goal_tags` header is absent, gate exits non-zero.
- **AC-F4-5:** Fault-injection regression test present for column reorder scenario. A fixture or inline test demonstrates MF-2 still fires `BAD=1` when `goal_tags` column is in a non-standard position.

---

### F5 — Local Markdownlint Pre-Commit Hook

**What it does:** Ships an opt-in `scripts/install-pre-commit.sh` that installs a local `.git/hooks/pre-commit` applying the same markdownlint ruleset as CI. Closes CF-v2.4-F and P-COWORK-1 (4th consecutive cycle carry).

**Opt-in design:** The hook is NOT installed automatically. Contributors run `scripts/install-pre-commit.sh` to opt in. This is consistent with the project's zero-forced-tooling posture (no npm, no package.json, no mandatory setup). Script documented in CONTRIBUTING.md as a recommended first-time setup step.

**Ruleset consistency:** The pre-commit hook uses the same `.markdownlintrc` or inline ruleset as the `markdown-lint` CI step in `quality.yml`. If the CI ruleset changes, the script must reference the same config source — not a copy.

**Scope:**
- `scripts/install-pre-commit.sh` — writes `.git/hooks/pre-commit` that runs `markdownlint` on staged `.md` files using repo ruleset.
- CONTRIBUTING.md updated to document the script under a new "Local Development" section.
- CI `quality.yml` `markdown-lint` step updated to note the pre-commit hook as the local equivalent (comment only — no behavioral change).

**Out of scope for v2.5:** Husky, lint-staged, or any npm-based pre-commit framework. Shell script only.

**ACs:**
- **AC-F5-1:** `scripts/install-pre-commit.sh` exists. `ls -la scripts/install-pre-commit.sh` exits 0.
- **AC-F5-2:** The script invokes `markdownlint` using the same ruleset reference as the CI `markdown-lint` step. `grep -c "markdownlint" scripts/install-pre-commit.sh` >= 1.
- **AC-F5-3:** CONTRIBUTING.md contains a "Local Development" section (or equivalent heading) that references `scripts/install-pre-commit.sh`. `grep -c "install-pre-commit" CONTRIBUTING.md` >= 1.
- **AC-F5-4:** Pre-commit hook, when installed and run against a staged file with a markdownlint violation, exits non-zero and blocks the commit. Verified by @qa via local test during Phase 5, or by a documented manual test procedure in `docs/architecture.md`.

---

## Out of Scope (v2.5)

- **v3.0 work.** No fork of the upstream skills repository. No multi-tool wizard step. No bulk SKILL.md reformatting beyond adding the `tools:` field. No Copilot/Cursor/Windsurf install path.
- **CF-v2.4-D (preset community PR contribution workflow).** Re-deferred to v2.6+. Rationale above under F3.
- **CF-v2.4-E (LLM-based goal matching).** Backlog. Activate only if keyword-match <80% in field data. No field data yet.
- **ADR-020 supply-chain changes.** Lock contract semantics preserved. `content_sha256` is additive. No schema_version bump.
- **New skill additions.** Pool remains at 20 skills. Only the `tools:` field is added to existing files.
- **`tools:` routing logic in wizard.** Wizard reads `tools:` as informational only at v2.5. Routing branch is v3.0 scope.
- **Bulk upstream contribution.** Only `meeting-notes` is reformatted and submitted. Other 19 skills remain in Cowork-only format.
- **Naming/rebranding review.** Deferred to v3.0 naming review.

---

## Technical Constraints

- **Stack:** No application runtime. Markdown + bash scripts. Delivered as a public GitHub repo (ZIP-downloadable). All CI via GitHub Actions.
- **Lock contract (ADR-020):** `cowork.lock.json` schema version `"1.0"` preserved. `content_sha256` is additive. ADR-020 semantics unchanged.
- **Supply chain (ADR-022):** `sync-agency.yml` SCAN_PATTERNS (lines 143+220) byte-unchanged. All 8 SCAN_PATTERNS preserved. F1 adds a verify step; it does not modify the SCAN_PATTERNS block.
- **Skill format (ADR-007/ADR-015):** SKILL.md 9-section body structure preserved. `tools:` is a frontmatter-only change. skill-depth-check passes on all 20 skills post-F2.
- **Attribution (ADR-024):** Attribution injection in WIZARD.md Step 5 is byte-unchanged. The upstream contribution (F3) does NOT use the ADR-024 attribution block — upstream files follow upstream's format. This distinction is @compliance's verification surface at Phase 2 `/legal`.
- **THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md (ADR-025):** The upstream community skills repository is already named in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`. No new third-party entries required for F3 (outbound contribution, not inbound import). @compliance confirms at Phase 2.
- **Public-copy hygiene rule:** Internal repository names, tool names, and upstream maintainer identifiers MUST NOT appear in README, CHANGELOG promotional copy, SETUP-CHECKLIST, or any user-facing surface. They MAY appear in `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/spec.md`, `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, and internal pipeline docs.
- **Cycle envelope:** v2.4 was ~47 files / +3827/-652 delta. v2.5 estimated: ~35 files / ~950 lines net. Within normal yardstick.
- **markdownlint:** No MD058 violations in F2 additions. F5 pre-commit script uses same ruleset. CI must pass on first push (0% rework rate norm holds).
- **Commit topology (ADR-033 / v2.4 F7 pattern):** Phase 0/1/2 docs (spec, architecture, security-review) must be committed in PR #N Commit 6 (REQUIRED label per F7 mandatory-paperwork-commit topology).

---

## User Stories

- As Alex (student, Claude Code user), I can trust that the skills installed by the wizard are byte-verified against the upstream pinned commit, so my workspace is not silently corrupted by an upstream content swap.
- As Maria (knowledge worker), I can see that each skill in my workspace is tagged for my tool, so I know which skills are validated for my setup when multi-tool support ships in a future version.
- As a contributor, I can run `bash scripts/install-pre-commit.sh` once to get the same markdownlint gate locally as CI, so I catch markdown formatting failures before pushing.
- As the project maintainer, I can submit a Cowork-original skill to an upstream skills community so that the upstream relationship is established before v3.0 and the acknowledgment outcome informs the v3.0 gate decision.

## Classification

**SECURITY-SENSITIVE.**
- F1 (lock integrity): extends the supply-chain trust model (ADR-020/022 surface). Combined-path NOT eligible. Phase 2 `/review` (@security FULL OWASP+LLM Top 10 pass) required. Phase 6 `/audit` FULL pass required.
- F3 (first outbound contribution): first-time external-repository interaction from Cowork. Exposes repo identity. Governance handoff surface.

**COMPLIANCE-SENSITIVE.**
- F3 triggers external content detection: outbound contribution to a third-party MIT-licensed repo with structural reformatting of Cowork content. Per pipeline-policy.md §ThirdPartyContentImport, @compliance must run at Phase 2 (`/legal`) AND Phase 6.
- Key compliance questions for @compliance at Phase 2:
  1. Does contributing a reformatted Cowork skill to an MIT repo require any attribution survival in the skill file, or is PR-description attribution sufficient?
  2. Does ADR-024 attribution block apply to outbound contributions, or only to inbound installs? (Architecture says inbound only — @compliance to confirm.)
  3. Is `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` (ADR-025) updated to reflect outbound contribution, or does it only track inbound third-party content?
  4. Are there any GitHub Terms of Service concerns with the upstream repo accepting PRs?

**Combined-path:** NOT eligible (SECURITY-SENSITIVE lock, same as v2.4). @security must run FULL audit at Phase 2 and Phase 6 independently.

## Open Questions for @architect

**OQ-v2.5-1 (F1 — verify step placement):** Should the `content_sha256` verify step in `sync-agency.yml` run inside the existing fetch job or as a new dedicated job/step? Recommendation needed before @dev implements to avoid topology ambiguity. Binding decision in ADR-028 implementation record.

**OQ-v2.5-2 (F1 — initial hash population):** When `content_sha256` is added to `cowork.lock.json` for the first time, the values must be computed from the actual files at pinned commit `783f6a72`. Strategy: (a) @dev runs a one-time local computation script and commits the values, or (b) the first `sync-agency.yml` run after merge computes and writes them. Which approach is correct given the lock file's update cadence and the no-force-push constraint?

**OQ-v2.5-3 (F2 — CI gate placement):** Should the `tools:` vocabulary gate be a new dedicated step in `quality.yml` or an extension of the existing MF-1 step? MF-1 targets `selection-presets.md`; the new gate targets `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter. Separate step is recommended for clarity — @architect to confirm.

**OQ-v2.5-4 (F3 — upstream-contribution/ directory CI exclusion):** Should `upstream-contribution/meeting-notes-upstream.md` be excluded from the `skill-depth-check` CI gate? If not excluded, the gate fires because the file does not follow the 9-section Cowork template. @architect to issue binding constraint.

**OQ-v2.5-5 (F4 — pipefail scope):** If `set -o pipefail` is adopted to replace `|| true` in MF-1/MF-2, does this affect other pipeline steps in the same `run:` block that legitimately use `|| true` for non-error paths? @architect to confirm scope of fix — pipefail per-step vs. explicit empty-check approach.

## Edge Cases

**EC-1 (F1 — empty files[] array):** If `cowork.lock.json` `files[]` is empty, the verify step must succeed gracefully (0 files to verify = 0 mismatches) rather than failing with a shell error. @architect to address in ADR-028 implementation note.

**EC-2 (F1 — network fetch failure):** If `sync-agency.yml` cannot fetch a file from GitHub during the verify step (network timeout, 404), the step must exit non-zero (fail-closed), not silently pass. Distinct failure message from "hash mismatch" required.

**EC-3 (F2 — tools: field absent from future skill):** A new skill added post-v2.5 without a `tools:` field must fail CI. The default rule applies at wizard runtime; CI enforces presence. @architect to confirm this interpretation.

**EC-4 (F3 — upstream PR rejected before Phase 7):** If the upstream PR is rejected before Phase 5 closes, AC-F3-5 (valid PR URL) still passes — rejection is a valid PR state. The v3.0 trigger evaluation handles outcomes. @qa must not fail v2.5 Phase 7 due to PR rejection.

**EC-5 (F4 — goal_tags column absent from header):** If the `goal_tags` column header is missing from `curated-skills-registry.md`, the MF-2 awk column-name lookup must exit non-zero (fail-closed). The gate cannot silently skip the vocabulary check because the column is not found.

**EC-6 (F5 — markdownlint not installed locally):** If a contributor runs the pre-commit hook and `markdownlint` is not installed, the hook must exit with a clear error message and block the commit. Must not silently succeed.

---

## Success Metrics

- **Primary:** v2.5 CI green on first push to release/v2.5.0 (0% rework rate — 4-cycle PASS-ON-FIRST-PUSH norm holds).
- **Secondary — v3.0 trigger evaluation readiness:**
  - F3 PR opened within 5 days of v2.5.0 tag.
  - AC-F1-3 fault-injection fires correctly at ship time.
  - All 20 skills pass `tools:` vocabulary gate.
- **Tertiary — carry-forward reduction:**
  - CF-v2.4-A resolved (ADR-028 ACCEPTED).
  - CF-v2.4-B + CF-v2.4-G bundled and resolved (MF-1/MF-2 hardening).
  - CF-v2.4-F resolved (P-COWORK-1 pattern closes after 4 cycles).
  - CF-v2.4-D re-deferred with explicit rationale. CF-v2.4-E backlogged with condition.

---

## Assumptions

- **[CONFIRMED]** `cowork.lock.json` `files[]` entries already contain a `sha256` field. F1 adds `content_sha256` as a second integrity field. No field rename required.
- **[CONFIRMED]** A meeting-notes equivalent does not exist in the upstream's `project-management/` category. Contribution is additive, not a duplicate.
- **[CONFIRMED]** MIT license at upstream pinned commit allows PRs and derivative works without relicensing. @compliance confirms F3 attribution at Phase 2.
- **[ESTIMATED]** Writing upstream-format `meeting-notes-upstream.md` from scratch requires approximately 2-3 hours of structured rewrite. Within one-cycle scope for @dev.
- **[ESTIMATED]** MF-2 awk column-name refactor adds approximately 10-15 lines to the quality.yml step. No architectural change required.
- **[UNTESTED]** Upstream maintainer acknowledges PR within 60 days. No prior interaction history. v3.0 gate review handles the unknown.
- **[UNTESTED]** Pre-commit hook works on contributor machines without `markdownlint` installed at the global path. EC-6 covers the failure mode.

---

## Re-defer Rationale

**CF-v2.4-D (preset community PR contribution workflow):** Explicitly re-deferred to v2.6+. The community PR workflow's design depends on whether Cowork has an upstream relationship (Model C) or stays internal-only (Model A fallback). F3's outcome determines this. Designing the workflow before F3 returns a signal would require a rework cycle.

**CF-v2.4-E (LLM-based goal matching):** Backlog. Activation condition: keyword matching produces less than 80% accuracy in field testing data. No field testing data exists yet. Condition not met.

---

## One-Cycle-Fit Verdict: PASS

**Analysis:**
- F1: approximately 8 files, 150 lines (lock file population + sync-agency.yml verify step + ADR-028 implementation note + fault-injection fixture).
- F2: approximately 22 files, 600 lines (20 SKILL.md frontmatter line additions + quality.yml vocabulary gate step + ADR amendment).
- F3: approximately 5 files, 120 lines (upstream-format file ~70L + CHANGELOG entry + architecture.md F3 note + upstream-contribution/ directory).
- F4: approximately 2 files, 30 lines (quality.yml MF-1/MF-2 hardening + regression fixture).
- F5: approximately 3 files, 50 lines (install script + CONTRIBUTING.md update + quality.yml comment).

**Estimated total:** approximately 35 files, 950 lines net additions. Well within normal cycle yardstick (20-50 files, 2000-3000 line delta). No split required.

---

## WILL-NOT-DO List (v2.5)

1. Fork the upstream skills repository — deferred to v3.0 gate review outcome.
2. Multi-tool wizard step — v3.0 scope.
3. Bulk SKILL.md reformatting beyond `tools:` field addition — v3.0 scope.
4. Any SKILL.md body changes (9-section structure preserved per ADR-015).
5. `schema_version` bump in `cowork.lock.json` — F1 is additive.
6. New skills added to pool — pool stays at 20.
7. Copilot/Cursor/Windsurf install paths — v3.0 scope.
8. Preset community PR contribution workflow (CF-v2.4-D) — re-deferred with explicit rationale.
9. LLM-based goal matching (CF-v2.4-E) — condition not met.
10. ADR-020/022 supply-chain architecture changes — SCAN_PATTERNS and lock contract preserved.
11. Upstream repository names, tool names, or maintainer identifiers in any public-facing copy.
12. npm/Node.js toolchain addition for pre-commit — shell script only per zero-toolchain posture.

## Architectural Modifications

*Populated by @architect at Phase 1 close — 2026-05-09T20:00Z.*

- AC: AC-F1-5 (`cmp` exit 0 on sync-agency.yml lines 143 and 220 before/after PR) → Verifier mechanism amended to `git diff` regex over SCAN_PATTERNS+accumulator regions — Reason: F1 verify step is INSERTED between line 143 (SCAN_PATTERNS start) and line 220 (accumulator append region), displacing line numbers downstream of the insertion point. A frozen-line `cmp` would falsely fail on byte-identical content. Verifier semantics preserved (no SCAN_PATTERNS or accumulator drift); mechanism amended. See C-v2.5-5 in architecture.md.
- AC: AC-F2-4 (`grep -c "tools:" docs/architecture.md` >= 4) → Numerically unchanged but @architect notes the verifier counts ANY `tools:` literal across architecture.md (including ADR-029 prose). Practical floor at v2.5 is much higher. No AC change required.

No other modifications. All 33 spec ACs achievable as-written.

### v2.5.2 modifications

*Populated by @architect at v2.5.2 Phase 1 close — 2026-05-10T00:00:00Z.*

- AC: AC-ZD-4 (`docs/architecture.md` git diff empty) → Re-interpreted as "no new ADRs, no ADR mutations, no rewrite of existing ADR sections; append-only Phase 1 design record permitted." — Reason: Project pipeline convention from v2.0 onward appends a per-cycle Phase 1 design record under a `## v<cycle> Phase 1` heading (precedents: v2.0, v2.0.2, v2.0.3, v2.3.0, v2.3.1, v2.5.1). Strict literal AC-ZD-4 verification (empty `git diff`) conflicts with this established record-keeping. The literal interpretation would suppress the architectural ledger that downstream agents bind against. Phase 4 verification: `awk '/^## ADR-[0-9]+/{print}' docs/architecture.md` returns 30 ADRs (unchanged from v2.5.1 HEAD); the only diff is the appended `## v2.5.2 Phase 1 — Quality Loop Design` section. See `docs/architecture.md` v2.5.2 Phase 1 § 2 for the full re-interpretation contract.

No other v2.5.2 modifications. All 21 v2.5.2 spec ACs achievable as-written.

> **Mode:** quick

---

## Problem

Every user who opens the cowork-starter-kit today and does not enable Extended Thinking, or who runs on Sonnet instead of Opus, is leaving measurable quality on the table. The kit's onboarding (README Quick-start, SETUP-CHECKLIST, WIZARD) never instructs users to flip these two decisive quality knobs. This gap was identified from studying how experienced Claude users approach model quality — both Extended Thinking and Opus selection are consistently cited as the highest-leverage session-setup steps.

---

## Target Users

**Primary:** First-time kit users following the Quick-start or SETUP-CHECKLIST. They need the two setup instructions on screen before they type their first prompt.

**Secondary:** Returning users who open WIZARD.md for model guidance. They need Opus + Extended Thinking framing to replace the vague "Sonnet or higher" prior recommendation.

---

## Core Features (MVP)

### D-1a — README.md Quick-start Leading Bullets

Add two leading bullets at the top of the Quick-start section (before existing steps):
- "Toggle Extended Thinking ON in Cowork before you start"
- "Select Opus 4.x in the model dropdown"

- AC: AC-D1-1: `grep -ic "extended thinking" README.md` >= 1
- AC: AC-D1-4: `grep -ic "opus" README.md` >= 1 (model selection guidance)

### D-1b — SETUP-CHECKLIST.md "Before you start" Preface

Add a "Before you start" section above the existing 10-step checklist containing the same two items (Extended Thinking toggle + Opus selection).

- AC: AC-D1-2: `grep -ic "extended thinking" SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` >= 1
- AC: AC-D1-5: `grep -ic "opus" SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` >= 1
- AC: AC-D1-7: SETUP-CHECKLIST.md contains a "Before you start" section header at the top

### D-1c — WIZARD.md Model Guidance Update

Replace the current "Sonnet or higher" model recommendation with explicit Opus + Extended Thinking guidance. The existing `opusplan` notes for cost-sensitive presets (Research / Writing / Project-Management) are preserved — they remain valid cost-sensitive guidance.

- AC: AC-D1-3: `grep -ic "extended thinking" WIZARD.md` >= 1
- AC: AC-D1-6: `grep -ic "opus" WIZARD.md` >= 1
- AC: AC-D1-8: WIZARD.md does NOT contain the verbatim string "Sonnet or higher" (replaced)

---

## Out of Scope (v2.5.1)

- No new files
- No skill changes (skills/ pool untouched)
- No global-instructions.md changes (per-preset files untouched)
- No CI/quality.yml changes
- No CLAUDE.md word-count changes
- No cowork.lock.json changes
- No "Next up" teaser rewrite (stays v2.6 multi-tool)
- D-2 (prompt-gate skill) and D-3 (correcting-course rule) deferred to v2.5.2

---

## Technical Constraints

- **Stack:** Markdown + bash scripts. No application runtime.
- **CLAUDE.md word count:** Untouched. Must remain at 397 words (v2.5.0 value per AC-ZD-3 baseline).
- **"Next up" teaser:** README.md teaser pointing to v2.6 multi-tool authoring is UNCHANGED. Published commitment is binding.
- **cowork.lock.json:** Byte-unchanged (zero-diff).
- **skills/ pool:** Byte-unchanged (zero-diff).
- **ADR-033 release pattern:** VERSION + CHANGELOG + README badge + "Next up" teaser as atomic release commit.
- **Branch:** release/v2.5.1

---

## User Stories

- As a first-time user reading the README Quick-start, I see a reminder to toggle Extended Thinking ON and select Opus before I begin, so I get the best quality output from my first session.
- As a user running through the SETUP-CHECKLIST, I encounter a "Before you start" preface with Extended Thinking and Opus guidance before the 10-step checklist begins, so I configure the session correctly before proceeding.
- As a user consulting WIZARD.md for model guidance, I see explicit Opus + Extended Thinking instructions rather than a vague "Sonnet or higher" recommendation, so I know exactly what to set.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Surface | Criterion | Verification |
|----|---------|-----------|--------------|
| AC-D1-1 | README.md | Extended Thinking mentioned | `grep -ic "extended thinking" README.md` >= 1 |
| AC-D1-2 | SETUP-CHECKLIST.md | Extended Thinking mentioned | `grep -ic "extended thinking" SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` >= 1 |
| AC-D1-3 | WIZARD.md | Extended Thinking mentioned | `grep -ic "extended thinking" WIZARD.md` >= 1 |
| AC-D1-4 | README.md | Opus mentioned (model selection) | `grep -ic "opus" README.md` >= 1 |
| AC-D1-5 | SETUP-CHECKLIST.md | Opus mentioned | `grep -ic "opus" SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` >= 1 |
| AC-D1-6 | WIZARD.md | Opus mentioned | `grep -ic "opus" WIZARD.md` >= 1 |
| AC-D1-7 | SETUP-CHECKLIST.md | "Before you start" section header at top | `grep -ic "before you start" SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` >= 1 |
| AC-D1-8 | WIZARD.md | "Sonnet or higher" string removed | `grep -c "Sonnet or higher" WIZARD.md` = 0 |
| AC-REL-1 | VERSION | Patch bump applied | `cat VERSION` = `2.5.1` |
| AC-REL-2 | CHANGELOG.md | v2.5.1 entry present | `head CHANGELOG.md \| grep -c '## \[2.5.1\]'` = 1 |
| AC-REL-3 | README.md | Badge updated | `grep -c 'version-2.5.1-green' README.md` = 1 |
| AC-REL-4 | README.md | "Next up" teaser unchanged | `grep -c 'Next up (v2.6)' README.md` >= 1 |
| AC-ZD-1 | cowork.lock.json | Byte-unchanged | `cmp` exit 0 vs v2.5.0 HEAD |
| AC-ZD-2 | skills/ pool | No SKILL.md edits | `cmp` exit 0 for all skills/ |
| AC-ZD-3 | CLAUDE.md | Word count unchanged | `wc -w CLAUDE.md` = 397 |
| AC-ZD-4 | Changed files | Only 5 files changed | `git diff main..release/v2.5.1 --stat` shows ONLY: README.md, SETUP-CHECKLIST.md, WIZARD.md, VERSION, CHANGELOG.md |

**Total: 8 D1 ACs + 4 REL ACs + 4 ZD ACs = 16 ACs**

---

## Edge Cases

**EC-1 — opusplan notes preservation:** WIZARD.md cost-sensitive preset notes referencing `opusplan` must NOT be removed. Verify `grep -c "opusplan" WIZARD.md` equals v2.5.0 baseline count post-edit.

**EC-2 — "Next up" teaser integrity:** README.md teaser line must contain "v2.6" literally. Any accidental edit during badge bump fails AC-REL-4.

**EC-3 — Section placement in SETUP-CHECKLIST.md:** "Before you start" must appear ABOVE the existing numbered checklist. If placed below, AC-D1-7 passes but the user intent (pre-checklist setup gate) is defeated. @qa verifies section ordering by line number during Phase 5.

**EC-4 — WIZARD.md partial replacement:** If "Sonnet or higher" is removed but Extended Thinking / Opus guidance is NOT added in its place, AC-D1-8 passes but AC-D1-3/D1-6 fail. @qa must verify all three WIZARD.md ACs together.

---

## Success Metrics

- **Primary:** 5-file diff on first push to release/v2.5.1. CI green. Zero rework.
- **Secondary:** All 16 ACs verified by @qa at Phase 5. No findings.
- **Tertiary:** "Before you start" guidance visible within the first screen of SETUP-CHECKLIST.md — user encounters Extended Thinking + Opus framing before reading any setup step.

---

## Assumptions

- **[CONFIRMED]** v2.5.0 shipped 2026-05-09. Retro complete. Cycle-reset marker absent — new cycle starts clean.
- **[CONFIRMED]** "Next up (v2.6): Multi-tool skill authoring" is publicly committed in README.md. This teaser stays unchanged.
- **[CONFIRMED]** WIZARD.md contains the string "Sonnet or higher" at v2.5.0 HEAD — to be replaced.
- **[CONFIRMED]** D-2 (prompt-gate skill) and D-3 (correcting-course rule) are deferred to v2.5.2 per approved plan at ~/.claude/plans/self-is-working-in-immutable-meerkat.md.
- **[ESTIMATED]** Doc edits to three files take less than 30 minutes of @dev time.
- **[UNTESTED]** Users who follow the "Before you start" guidance see measurably better output quality. No user data yet — this is the hypothesis.

## v2.5.2 Cycle — Quality Loop (D-2 + D-3)

> **Cycle:** v2.5.2 — Quality Loop
> **Version bump:** v2.5.1 → v2.5.2 (PATCH — opt-in new skill; see Patch-Level Exception note)
> **Status:** Phase 0 — Requirements
> **Date:** 2026-05-10T00:00:00Z
> **Replaces:** v2.5.1 spec (doc-only patch)
> **Classification:** COMPLIANCE-SENSITIVE
> **Routing:** Phase 2 `/legal` (@compliance) REQUIRED before `/design` — prompt-gate skill traces to external MIT-licensed pattern (addyosmani/agent-skills). Attribution preservation must be verified by @compliance before architecture is finalized.
> **Mode:** full

---

### Problem

Two quality-of-interaction gaps exist for every user who opens the kit:

1. **Vague prompts get generic answers.** When a user types an ambiguous or context-thin request, Claude has no automated path to enrich that request before executing. The `context/about-me.md`, `writing-profile.md`, and `working-rules.md` files exist precisely to inform execution — but Claude only reads them if the user or a SKILL.md rule directs it to. No automated gate bridges the gap between a vague prompt and those context files.

2. **Output corrections require full retyping.** When a user says "this is off" or "not quite right," the current behavior is to ask the user to re-describe what they want — forcing them to reproduce context they already provided. This is friction. A structured correction form with chips (tone / scope / format / depth / sources) lets users steer without retyping.

Both gaps compound over every session. A kit user who gets consistently generic answers from vague prompts is a kit user who stops using the kit.

---

### Scope

**D-2 — `skills/prompt-gate/SKILL.md` (NEW)**

A Cowork-native port of The-Council's prompt-gate pattern. Four-phase workflow:

1. **Context check** — read `context/about-me.md`, `writing-profile.md`, `working-rules.md`. If any file is missing OR contains unfilled template placeholders AND is clearly relevant to the requested task → emit AskUserQuestion with chips "Fill now" / "Skip" / "Run the wizard". If the file is irrelevant to the task → silently skip.
2. **Workspace research** — scan PROJECTS/TEMPLATES and any cowork-profile.md for context relevant to the request.
3. **Clarify** — emit 1–3 AskUserQuestion items grounded in Phase 1 + Phase 2 findings. Never ask a question answerable from the context files.
4. **Execute** — proceed with enriched understanding. Do not re-surface resolved questions.

Self-evaluation gate: the skill must decide whether to fire at all. Trivial prompts (clear intent, bounded scope, no context dependency) proceed directly to Phase 4. The `*` prefix bypass is preserved (Council convention: `*` prefix = skip evaluation, execute directly).

Wired into all 7 presets' `global-instructions.md` — kit auto-loading carries the rule into every session without user paste.

**D-3 — `prompts/correcting-course.md` (NEW) + global-instructions injection**

A correction-handling rule: "When the user says output is off, do not ask them to re-type. Generate an AskUserQuestion form with concrete adjustment chips (tone / scope / format / depth / sources). Free-text remains the escape hatch via an 'Other' chip."

Stored as `prompts/correcting-course.md` and injected by reference into all 7 presets' `global-instructions.md`.

**Release artifacts**

- `VERSION` bump: 2.5.1 → 2.5.2
- `README.md` badge: version badge value rotates 2.5.1 → 2.5.2
- `CHANGELOG.md` [2.5.2] entry: lists prompt-gate + correcting-course in user terms; includes Patch-Level Exception note
- `README.md` "Next up (v2.6)" teaser: UNCHANGED (locked — multi-tool is publicly committed)
- GitHub release body: cites prompt-gate + correcting-course in plain language; flags patch exception

**Patch-Level Exception note (required in release artifacts):**
> "A new opt-in skill (prompt-gate) ships at patch level here because the v2.6 minor slot is publicly committed to multi-tool skill authoring. The skill is auto-loaded via global-instructions but can be removed from any preset's global-instructions.md without other changes. Future new-skill cycles default back to minor version bumps."

---

### Acceptance Criteria

**D-2 — prompt-gate skill**

- **AC-D2-1:** `skills/prompt-gate/SKILL.md` exists and passes the existing CI `skill-depth-check` gate (9-section structure, ≥60 line floor, `tools: [claude-code]` frontmatter field present). `grep -c "tools:" skills/prompt-gate/SKILL.md` = 1.
- **AC-D2-2:** Prompt-gate 4-phase workflow is present in SKILL.md: Phase 1 context check, Phase 2 workspace research, Phase 3 clarify (1–3 questions), Phase 4 execute. Each phase heading appears as a heading in the file.
- **AC-D2-3:** `*` prefix bypass is documented in SKILL.md: a section or note explicitly states that prompts beginning with `*` skip evaluation and execute directly.
- **AC-D2-4:** Missing/placeholder file detection is documented: SKILL.md specifies that if `context/about-me.md`, `writing-profile.md`, or `working-rules.md` is absent OR contains unfilled template placeholders AND is relevant to the task, the skill emits an AskUserQuestion with chips "Fill now" / "Skip" / "Run the wizard".
- **AC-D2-5:** Self-evaluation gate is documented: SKILL.md includes guidance on when NOT to fire (trivial prompts — clear intent, bounded scope, no context dependency).
- **AC-D2-6:** Attribution block is present in SKILL.md tracing the 4-phase pattern to the MIT-licensed source (addyosmani/agent-skills), matching the format used in The-Council's prompt-gate SKILL.md.
- **AC-D2-7:** All 7 presets' `global-instructions.md` files contain a prompt-gate reference block. `grep -rl "prompt-gate" examples/*/global-instructions.md | wc -l` = 7.
- **AC-D2-8:** `curated-skills-registry.md` contains a row for `prompt-gate` under an appropriate section (all goal_tags, Tier 1, source_url = builtin). `grep -c "prompt-gate" curated-skills-registry.md` = 1.
- **AC-D2-9 (edge case — irrelevant file):** SKILL.md documents that if a context file exists but is irrelevant to the task (e.g., writing-profile.md exists but the task is a math calculation), the skill silently skips that file rather than surfacing it.
- **AC-D2-10 (edge case — all context present):** SKILL.md documents behavior when all context files are present and filled: skip Phase 1 bootstrap offer entirely, proceed to Phase 2.
- **AC-D2-11 (edge case — trivial prompt):** SKILL.md documents what constitutes a trivial prompt that bypasses enrichment (example: "What time is it?", "Summarize this paragraph:" with content attached).

**D-3 — correcting-course**

- **AC-D3-1:** `prompts/correcting-course.md` exists. File defines the correction-handling rule: when user says output is off, do not ask for retyping; emit AskUserQuestion form with adjustment chips covering at minimum: tone, scope, format, depth, sources.
- **AC-D3-2:** An "Other" free-text escape chip is documented in `prompts/correcting-course.md`.
- **AC-D3-3:** All 7 presets' `global-instructions.md` files contain a correcting-course reference block. `grep -rl "correcting-course" examples/*/global-instructions.md | wc -l` = 7.
- **AC-D3-4 (edge case — cascading correction):** `prompts/correcting-course.md` documents behavior for multiple consecutive corrections: each correction generates a fresh AskUserQuestion form; prior unanswered form chips do not persist.

**Release artifacts**

- **AC-REL-1:** `VERSION` file contains exactly `2.5.2`. `cat VERSION` = `2.5.2`.
- **AC-REL-2:** `README.md` version badge URL value contains `2.5.2`. `grep "version-2.5.2" README.md` returns a match.
- **AC-REL-3:** `README.md` "Next up (v2.6)" line is byte-identical to HEAD v2.5.1. `grep "Next up" README.md` = `**Next up (v2.6):** Multi-tool skill authoring (v3.0 routing intent) — individual skills validated for Copilot/Cursor/Windsurf and widened beyond \`claude-code\`.` (exact).
- **AC-REL-4:** `CHANGELOG.md` contains a `## [2.5.2]` section prepended above `## [2.5.1]`. Section mentions prompt-gate and correcting-course by name.
- **AC-REL-5:** `CHANGELOG.md` [2.5.2] section contains the Patch-Level Exception note explaining why a new skill ships at patch level.
- **AC-REL-6 (edge case — ordering):** `CHANGELOG.md` version order is: [2.5.2] above [2.5.1] above [2.5.0]. No version entry is out of sequence.

**Preservation invariants (zero-diff)**

- **AC-ZD-1:** `cowork.lock.json` is byte-unchanged from v2.5.1 HEAD. `cmp cowork.lock.json <v2.5.1-HEAD-cowork.lock.json>` exits 0.
- **AC-ZD-2:** `CLAUDE.md` word count ≤ 400. `wc -w CLAUDE.md` ≤ 400.
- **AC-ZD-3:** No existing preset's core content files (other than `global-instructions.md`) are modified. Only `global-instructions.md` changes in each preset folder.
- **AC-ZD-4:** `docs/architecture.md` is unchanged (no new ADRs this cycle — prompt-gate is a skill, not an architectural decision requiring an ADR). `git diff HEAD -- docs/architecture.md` is empty.
- **AC-ZD-5:** CI workflow files (`.github/workflows/`) are unchanged except for any strictly required update to register the new skill in the CI depth-check `POOL` loop if `skills/prompt-gate/SKILL.md` is not auto-detected. If a CI change IS required: it is limited to adding `prompt-gate` to the POOL allowlist only. No other CI changes.

---

### Will-Not-Do (v2.5.2)

- v2.6 multi-tool skill authoring work — any change that widens the `tools:` vocabulary or adds Copilot/Cursor/Windsurf validation
- v2.5.3 v43 framework application (deferred — separate cycle)
- Any fix for open Issues #18–23 (separate cycles; these are v2.0.1 tech-debt and hallucinated SHA items)
- Changes to `cowork.lock.json`, `docs/architecture.md` (no new ADRs), or CI workflow files beyond the strict minimum in AC-ZD-5
- Changes to any preset's core content files other than `global-instructions.md`
- Any prompt-gate behavior that modifies user files without explicit user confirmation
- Adding a new `prompts/` directory if it requires CLAUDE.md changes beyond the word-count ceiling

### Classification

**COMPLIANCE-SENSITIVE.**

External content detection fired: The-Council's prompt-gate SKILL.md carries an attribution block tracing the 4-phase context-enrichment pattern to `addyosmani/agent-skills` (`skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md` @ commit `9534f44c5448086fcc0046f9d83752c654c81930`, MIT License). Porting this pattern to cowork's `skills/prompt-gate/SKILL.md` carries forward the same attribution obligation.

**Both repos (The-Council + cowork-starter-kit) are owned by the same author.** This is not a third-party import. However:
1. The underlying pattern is MIT-licensed from a third party (Addy Osmani).
2. The MIT License requires attribution preservation in any derived work.
3. Per `docs/pipeline-policy.md#ThirdPartyContentImport`, @compliance must verify attribution format before architecture is finalized.

**Required action:** Run `/legal` (Phase 2 @compliance) before `/design`. @compliance must confirm: (a) attribution block format in SKILL.md is sufficient for MIT license compliance, (b) `docs/ATTRIBUTIONS.md` in cowork should reference the same upstream source, and (c) no additional license obligations apply.

Classification is NOT SECURITY-SENSITIVE. The prompt-gate is opt-in via global-instructions, introduces no auth/RLS/schema/external-API surface, and handles no sensitive data. Standard STANDARD-tier security checks apply at Phase 6.

### Technical Constraints

- **Stack:** Markdown-only. No code, no dependencies, no package manager.
- **Skill format:** Must pass existing CI `skill-depth-check` gate: 9-section SKILL.md structure, ≥60 lines, `tools: [claude-code]` frontmatter.
- **Preset injection:** `global-instructions.md` is auto-loaded by Cowork when the preset folder is opened as a project. Injection must be additive (append new sections) — existing proactive-skill sections and session-start behaviors are not modified.
- **`prompts/` directory:** Does not currently exist. @architect must decide whether to create it as a bare directory or document its convention in `docs/architecture.md`. See AC-ZD-4 (no ADR required — prompt directory is a convention, not an architectural decision; a comment in CONTRIBUTING.md is sufficient).
- **CI impact:** The existing `skill-depth-check` CI job validates all `skills/*/SKILL.md` files. `prompt-gate` must either auto-pass or require only a minimal POOL allowlist addition (see AC-ZD-5).
- **Attribution:** The Cowork SKILL.md's attribution block must match the format used in The-Council's `docs/ATTRIBUTIONS.md` and the inline attribution in The-Council's prompt-gate SKILL.md.
- **Word budget:** `CLAUDE.md` must stay ≤ 400 words (AC-ZD-2). Prompt-gate and correcting-course are referenced from `global-instructions.md`, not CLAUDE.md — no CLAUDE.md changes expected.

### User Stories

- As a Cowork user opening a preset workspace with an unfilled context file, I want an automatic offer to fill it before my first task runs, so I don't get generic output because I forgot to configure my profile.
- As a Cowork user typing a vague request, I want Claude to ask 1–3 grounded clarifying questions before executing, so the output matches what I actually needed.
- As a Cowork user whose output missed the mark, I want a structured correction form with preset chips, so I can steer the next output without retyping my full context.
- As a Cowork user who knows exactly what they want, I want to prefix my message with `*` to skip the enrichment gate entirely, so I'm never blocked by a gate I don't need.
- As a Cowork preset user, I want prompt-gate and correcting-course behavior automatically loaded into every session, so I don't have to paste or configure anything.

---

### Success Metrics

- **Primary:** Prompt-gate fires on vague prompts in all 7 presets without user configuration (verified by AC-D2-7 grep pass).
- **Secondary:** Zero rework commits post-Phase-4 (target: 0% rework rate, consistent with v2.5.1 clean cycle).
- **Secondary:** CI passes on first push (42+ PASS / 0 FAIL target, consistent with v2.5.1 baseline).
- **Lagging (post-launch, unmeasured):** [UNTESTED] Users who receive a prompt-gate clarification form report better output relevance than users who do not. No measurement tooling exists yet.

---

### Risks

- **R1 [MEDIUM]:** Prompt-gate fires on trivial prompts, generating friction for experienced users. Mitigation: explicit self-evaluation gate in SKILL.md (AC-D2-5) + `*` prefix bypass (AC-D2-3). @security review at Phase 6 to verify no prompt-injection surface is introduced by AskUserQuestion chip options.
- **R2 [LOW]:** CI `skill-depth-check` rejects `prompt-gate` due to unrecognized structure or POOL allowlist gap. Mitigation: AC-ZD-5 explicitly scopes the allowed CI change. @dev must verify CI locally before pushing.
- **R3 [LOW]:** `prompts/` directory creation triggers an unexpected CI lint failure (new directory pattern not covered by existing gates). Mitigation: @architect assesses CI impact at Phase 1.
- **R4 [LOW-MEDIUM]:** Attribution block format in cowork's SKILL.md is insufficient for MIT license compliance (different repo context, no ATTRIBUTIONS.md equivalent yet). Mitigation: @compliance verifies at Phase 2 `/legal` before @architect finalizes the SKILL.md template.

### Assumptions

- **[CONFIRMED]** v2.5.1 Phase 8 complete. Cycle-reset marker present. Pipeline unblocked for v2.5.2.
- **[CONFIRMED]** The-Council prompt-gate SKILL.md carries attribution to `addyosmani/agent-skills` MIT License — porting requires attribution preservation. @compliance review mandatory.
- **[CONFIRMED]** All 7 preset folders are: `business-admin`, `creative`, `personal-assistant`, `project-management`, `research`, `study`, `writing`. Each has a `global-instructions.md`.
- **[CONFIRMED]** `prompts/` directory does not exist in the repo at v2.5.1 HEAD.
- **[CONFIRMED]** `README.md` "Next up (v2.6)" teaser is publicly committed and must be preserved byte-identical.
- **[CONFIRMED]** Existing CI `skill-depth-check` validates `skills/*/SKILL.md` pool. New `prompt-gate` skill must pass or require only POOL allowlist addition.
- **[ESTIMATED]** Prompt-gate and correcting-course rules together take @dev ≤ 2 hours to implement (markdown files, no code).
- **[UNTESTED]** The prompt-gate self-evaluation gate reliably skips trivial prompts without user instruction. Requires manual behavioral testing at Phase 5.
